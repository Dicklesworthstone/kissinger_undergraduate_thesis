<h2 id="introductory-note">Introductory Note</h2>
<p>An introduction to an undergraduate honor thesis may seem presumptuous, but I believe that its inordinate length and unorthodox method require an explanation. The length is due to the fact that I did not realize the implications of the subject when I started to work on the thesis. As it grew, I made several efforts to cut it down, such as omitting the chapters I had written on Hegel and Schweitzer. Since this still did not succeed in reducing this thesis to a more manageable size, I have pointed out, at the end of this introductory note, those portions which I believe to be the nucleus of my analysis and which may be considered my honor thesis.</p>
<p>The methodology results from my dissatisfaction with the critical treatments of Spengler, and to a lesser degree, of Toynbee. I had the impression that merely analytical criticism of Spengler falsifies the real essence of his philosophy. Just as in the case of Nietzsche, part of Spengler's impact resides in the poetic imaginativeness of his descriptions. I have therefore made a conscious effort in my expository passages to capture as much as possible of Spengler's style. This has entailed rather lengthy quotations and in one or two places close reliance on the text. To present Spengler's philosophy as fairly as possible, I have kept such clauses as "Spengler argues," "according to Spengler," etc., to a minimum; the expository passages are to be understood as containing Spengler's arguments. My comments are concentrated in discussions at the end of each section. My basic analysis is to be found in my "Conclusions" on the chapter "History - as - Intuition."</p>
<p>I have followed essentially the same methodology with Toynbee. Here too, purely analytical criticism falsifies the stately empirical approach. I have discussed each of Toynbee's main headings at sufficient length to indicate his method; though, except for a very few instances, I have omitted all his illustrations. Again, all my comments are contained in an introductory paragraph and in a concluding section to each heading. My fundamental criticisms are to be found under the title "Conclusions" at the end of the chapter "History - as - an - Empirical Science."</p>
<p>In each case, the expository passages are preceded by a discussion of the author's metaphysical assumptions to explain their structuring effect on the subsequent philosophy.</p>
<p>Since many excellent treatments of Kant's philosophy exist, my discussion of his philosophy is orthodox. My last chapter is intended to explain the general position from which I approached the philosophy of history. Needless to say, this is a still tentative viewpoint.</p>
<p>The Appendix was written after listening to a seminar paper by a logical positivist, in order to clarify my own thought on the meaning of "meaning," and also to indicate what criteria of validity logic offers to philosophy. It is based on a course with Prof. Henry Scheffer and personal consultations. The philosophical interpretation of the logical systems is my own. Though this analysis was written as a unit, the reader may, if he wishes, consider only the following sections as my honor thesis.</p>

<p>The Problem</p>
<p>In the life of every person, there comes a point when he realizes that out of all the seemingly limitless possibilities of his youth, he has in fact become one actuality. No longer is life a broad plain with forests and mountains beckoning all around; it becomes apparent that one's journey across the meadows has indeed followed a regular path, that one can no longer go this way or that, but that the direction is set and the limits defined. Each step once taken so thoughtlessly now becomes fraught with tremendous portent; each arrival to be made appears unalterable.</p>
<p>Looking back across the path, we are struck by the inexorability of the road, how every step both limited and served as a condition for the next. Viewing the plain, we feel with a certainty approaching knowledge that many roads were possible, that many incidents shaped our wandering, that we are here because it was we who journeyed, and we could be in a different spot had we wished. We know further that whatever road we had chosen, we could not have remained stationary. We were unable to avoid in any manner our being now in fact somewhere and in some position. We have come up against the problem of <em>Necessity</em> and <em>Freedom</em>, of the irrevocability of our actions, and of the directedness of our life.</p>
<p>What is the meaning of necessity and where does it arise? Necessity is an attribute of the past. Events viewed in retrospect appear inevitable, the fact of occurrence testifying to irrevocability. Causality expresses the pattern which the mind imposes on a sequence of events in order to make their appearance comprehensible. It is formulated as a law, which reveals a trend of recurrence and an assertion of comparability. Law overfights against the unique, against personal experience and inward bliss. Necessity recognizes only quantitative differences and conceives of survival as its sole test of historical fitness. Necessity discovers the typical in man.</p>
<p>The Inexorable in Events, the Inevitable in Existence</p>
<p>Its doctrine is the philosophy of <em>Eternal Recurrence</em>, of which the devil tells Ivan Karamazov, "But our present earth may have been repeated a thousand times. Why it has become extinct, been frozen, cracked, broken to bits, disintegrated into its elements, again the water above the firmament, then again a comet, again a sun, again from the sun it becomes earth and on earth the same sequence may have been repeated endlessly and exactly the same to every detail..."</p>
<p>Yet every event is not only an effect but also an inward experience. As an effect, it is ruled by necessity; as an experience, it reveals the unique in the personality. The desire to reconcile an experience of freedom with a determined environment is the lament of poetry and the dilemma of philosophy. Rationalism attempted to solve this problem by considering its purposes as the objective pattern of occurrences and equating freedom with necessity. This follows Kant's analysis of the categories.</p>
<p>The British skeptics, particularly Hume, submitted these notions to rigorous criticism and denied necessity as well as purposiveness. They argued that perception involves the impact of empirical entities on a wax-like mind, whose sensations of pleasure are largely passive, whose concept of necessity describes a constant conjunction, and to which freedom is meaningless. The limits of thought cannot be established by thought; however, Hume's skepticism caused him to abandon philosophy while still a young man, and Descartes was forced to invoke God as a guarantor of external reality with the aid of the very faculty the accuracy of which he had seriously questioned.</p>
<p>Kant realized that only an inward experience can transcend the inexorability of completed action. He "limited knowledge to make room for belief." He affirmed that the reality that is subject to the laws of causality is given by sensuous experiences and exhausted in the phenomenal world. But beyond that, man has a transcendental experience of freedom which elevates him above the realm of necessity into a higher world-order which conditions all appearances. Freedom is an inward state, an attitude that accompanies all action. This disproves Hume's assertion that nothing can be definitely known, since one can always imagine the opposite of any thought. Our experience of freedom testifies to a fact of existence which no thought process can deny and for the demonstration of which Descartes' <em>cogito ergo sum</em> was not really necessary.</p>
<p>Whatever conception one may form about the inevitability of actions, their accomplishment occurs with an inward conviction of choice. Freedom is the causality that motivates man. "To conceive a man having no freedom is impossible except as a man deprived of life," says Tolstoy.</p>
<p>What is the solution to the paradox of irrevocable action accomplished with the conviction of choice? How can we reconcile the experience of freedom with our knowledge that our intentions so frequently issue forth into totally incommensurate consequences? What is the meaning of a causality that accomplishes itself under the mode of freedom?</p>
<p>The philosophy of history has addressed itself to these problems. It testifies to humanity's yearning to understand the fatedness of life, to a mystic drive for an absolute, and to an attempt to give meaning to the basic questions of existence. For this reason, the philosophy of history is indissolubly connected with metaphysics; it is indeed metaphysics of a very high order.</p>
<h2 id="2-for-this-reason">2. For this Reason</h2>
<p>I have avoided the usual classification of philosophies of history into cyclical and progress theories. It seems to me that a classification in terms of metaphysical assumptions presents wider possibilities. Moreover, the philosophers discussed do not lend themselves well to such a classification. Toynbee combines the cyclical and the progress concepts. Spengler is a cyclical philosopher in Vico's tradition. Kant has a theory of progress achieved by conflict which, in its implications, is very similar to Toynbee. (See post Ch. History and Man's Experience of Morality). This section will examine whether history can in fact give an answer to these problems.</p>
<p>Is There a Meaning to History?</p>
<p>History, according to Popper, has no meaning. It is the chronicle of international crime and mass murder and takes no account of the tears and suffering of mankind. It is up to us, however, he states at a later point, to give meaning to history by assisting the open society to triumph in its eternal struggle with the closed society.</p>
<p>Aside from the inner contradiction of this argument, if history has no meaning, the eternal conflict between freedom and rationality against mysticism, historicism, and tyranny cannot be its motif. The passage illustrates the difficulty and confusion inherent in the word "meaning."</p>
<p>It implies:</p>
<ol>
<li>History has no meaning. 2. History has a meaning, but that meaning is unacceptable to Popper. 3. History has no meaning, but if freedom and rationality triumph, it will suddenly acquire content.</li>
</ol>
<p>These implications contain the dilemma of the problem of the meaning of history. Is history an open book, a set of theorems that contains in itself all the aspirations of mankind, as well as the key to the world's purpose? Or does history reveal a series of meaningless incidents, a challenge for our normative concepts, only through conformity to which it can obtain significance? Is meaning, in short, an attribute of reality or a metaphysical construction attendant on our recognition of significance? The logical positivists accept the former alternative. Meaning results from verifying statements with empirical facts.</p>
<p>The researches of anthropologists have dispelled the hope that the meaning of assertions could be given a firmer basis by making the physical world their criterion. It has been demonstrated that each culture and, to a certain extent, each individual constructs his own image of "reality," and that "facts" are in no manner as absolute and unshakable as assumed. The history of modern physics has been a continuous process of dissolving external reality and laying bare such mysterious and incompatible prime data as energy that works under the aspect of mass, and light that is demonstrably a wave but equally certainly contains all its physical properties in an elemental particle, the photon. Moreover, on this theory, as classical logic has well penalized, not only all value judgments but all quality judgments are meaningless. The difference between affirming an object's worth or its color is a difference in achieving a consensus, but not of empirical verifiability.</p>
<h1 id="traditional-logic">Traditional Logic</h1>
<p>Traditional logic was more aware of the problem of existential import. Each proposition had as its subject ultimate reality. A judgment, expressed in words, is the act of distinguishing a particular element, the predicate, in the being of a subject that contains a subject and implies existence. Reality is thus implied by, but not requisite for, judgments. The existential import theory of propositions presented too many difficulties. Though logicians could argue that statements about square circles did not imply existence since they involved mutually exclusive terms, reconciling definitional reality and all possible judgments proved impossible.</p>

<h1 id="sentential-logic">Sentential Logic</h1>
<p>Sentential logic abandoned the concept of the existential import of propositions. Its logical primitive is a sentence, which is a grouping of symbols that represent empirical entities. Only by being brought into relation with other physical objects do these sentences acquire meaning. Since a determination of truth and falsity does not precede every statement, sentential logic was forced to invoke another predicate of propositions: truth-weight. This is a purely psychological relation. However, this theory stumbled on the problem of defining a fact and reconciling truth-value and weight. Russell, in his later writings, and Prof. Scheffer have achieved a formulation attempting to determine the essence of meaning. Statements become replies to pure hypotheses, which have to be endorsed by the proper criterion. For example, the statement "Scott is the author of Waverley" is the affirmative answer, empirically endorsed, to the questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Did at least one man write Waverley? 2. Did only one man write Waverley? a. Was this man Scott?</li>
</ol>

<p>The Range of Meaningful Propositions</p>
<p>The range of meaningful propositions is not exhausted by the empirical realm. Proper criteria can be obtained for value theorems or aesthetic judgments. This theory recognizes the variability of metaphysical assumptions as a condition of meaning. Meaning becomes the function of three factors: the logical, expressed in the most precise formulation of the hypothesis; the psychological, inherent in the act of judging; and the philosophical, expressed in the endorsements. Universality depends on the consensus that this description of meaning enjoys, not on its empirical verifiability.</p>
<p>Thus, meaning represents the emanation of a metaphysical context. Just as every man creates his picture of the world and the scientist can find in nature only what he puts in it through the formulation of his hypothesis, every question determines at least the range of answers. History does not exhibit the same portent to everybody but yields only the meanings inherent in the nature of our query. Therefore, the philosophy of history is inseparable from metaphysics and involves a deep awareness of the mysteries.</p>
<p>The endorsement, in turn, is composed of a metaphysical element (the criterion) and an epistemological element (the assertion, not the judgment of truth and falsity).</p>
<p>"In the reaction of the various thinkers to the problems of human necessity and human freedom, in their capacity to experience depths inaccessible to reason alone, lies the answer to the meaning of history. Therefore, Popper's statement that history presents merely a chronicle of crime and sordor, with no awareness of the heartbreak of humanity, reveals his narrative concepts but does not represent a necessary attribute of events. That other levels of meaning exist is shown by Dostoevsky and Schweitzer, Homer and Shakespeare, to whom history was a deeply felt experience of transcendental import.</p>
<p>Who is right then? Is history the self-realization of the spirit of freedom as Hegel held? Or does it represent the growth and decline of organic cultures, their essence a mystery, their moving force longing, and their manifestation power, as Spengler argued? Is there a deeper purpose in all this emergence and decay of civilizations, a realization of salvation by Faith as Toynbee implies? Does history amount to no more than eternal recurrence, the stage for the Man who surpasses himself of Nietzsche, or does it reveal the drama of a divine plan, gradually unfolding and culminating in universal peace, as Kant asserts? If meaning is the metaphysical context that ascribes significance, does this preclude differentiation by which to judge validity? These criteria exist, but they are not as obvious as the logical positivists assumed.</p>
<p>Though the questions delimit the range of answers, we can require the answers to be relevant to the problem. Each culture, and perhaps each individual, interprets his data in an intensely personal way, but we can insist that the data be adhered to. We can analyze internal consistency. On another level, we can judge the adequacy of the thinker's philosophical assumptions by their scope, by their grasp of the totality of life, instead of just its appearances. Newton, sitting under the apple tree, might have correctly concluded that apples fall when ripe. It is not a question of right or wrong, therefore, but of depth and shallowness. It does not suffice to show logically deduced theorems as an absolute test of validity. There must also exist a relation to the pervasiveness of an inward experience that transcends phenomenal reality.</p>
<p>Kent did not ascribe the self-realization of peace to a divine plan, but to a natural unfolding. The implication, just as in Spinoza, is of a divine order in the cosmos.</p>
<p>Though man is a thinking being, it does not follow that his being exhausts itself in thinking. The ultimate mysteries of life are perhaps not approachable by dissection but may require the poet's view, who grasps the unity of life, which is greater than any, however painstaking, analysis of its manifestations. The Philosophy of History exhibits, therefore, in its metaphysical assumptions, an attitude towards the basic problems of existence. They reveal whether life is approached with reverence and humility or with the assertive tool of a reason that admits no reality outside itself. The resolution of the dilemma of historical events serving as the condition for a transcendental experience or reality exhausting itself in phenomenal appearances discloses the ethical predispositions of a personality, not a property of historical data.</p>
<h1 id="as-a-reflection-of-pesic-attitudes">As a Reflection of Pesic Attitudes</h1>
<p>Myth is the beginning of death; life is the process of mortality. Everything existing is modified by time; history exhibits the unfolding or growth, fulfillment, and outward decay. Man strives for knowledge and, having attained it, cannot bear it. All of literature contains an expression of this dilemma and of mankind's lament at the shortness of their interval. Hamlet becomes paralyzed by knowledge; Achilles purchases it at the price of his death. Thus is the appearance of life but not necessarily its meaning. The magic attitude towards life seeks to escape the transitoriness of its existence by conjuring its data. It attempts to find in history the necessary realization of its purposive concepts, to be classified as attributes of events. But purpose represents the emanation of a metaphysical context, not a necessary deduction from phenomena. No ethical value can be ascribed to the mere survival that history exhibits. For this reason, the magic attitude develops a philosophy of eternal recurrence as a condition for its cognition. Death becomes the result of fulfillment; life exhibits merely mortality, and history represents a machine continually reproducing new manifestations of power. Values are,Life is limited by classifiable data; it exhausts itself in the riddle of the first cause. The fact of occurrence reveals the only criterion of inward fitness.</p>
<p>The prayerful attitude, on the other hand, experiences life as a vision of reconciliation. One views a vast plain from a mountaintop when the haze obscures the countryside, and everything merges in a total impression of peace and harmony. The inevitability exhibited to retrospection attains a deeper meaning through a transcendental experience. The recognition of necessity becomes the condition for the attainment of inward liberation. Resignation to the purposes of the universe serves as the first step towards ethical activity, and the realization ensues that the meaning of history is not confined to its mere manifestations and that no causal analysis can absolve man from giving his own content to his own existence.</p>
<p>The philosophies of Spengler, Toynbee, and Kant contain expressions of these attitudes in the quest for the apprehension of the meaning of history. Spengler asserted that progress was not a category of meaning for history. Life contains the problem of motion, which results from the irrevocability of our actions and prevents us, in the eternal flux of things, from ever observing that which is in the act of observing itself, to ever causally determine the inner connectedness of events. This directedness of life is the source of the dual qualities of world-longing and world-dread that arise from our consciousness of mortality and our loneliness in a world in which we can never grasp the total inner meaning of others. The riddle of time opens up for man, not to be classified as a category of Reason as Kant attempted. Space is a conception, but time represents a denotation for something inconceivable.</p>
<p>It expresses itself in the eternal becoming that is the essence of man and that attains pure being--pure space--only at the moment of his death. Causality applies to the stiff forms of being; destiny and fate dominate becoming. Destiny answers the question of when, while causality answers the question of how. All of life is permeated by an inner destiny that can never be defined; history discloses a majestic unfolding that one can only intuitively perceive, never causally classify. Existence constitutes a mystic relationship to the extended, especially accessible to the artist and the great statesman, the mystery and the essence of which each culture perceives in a different fashion.</p>
<p>And what does Spengler see with this intuitive vision?</p>
<p>"A boundless mass of human beings, flowing in a stream with cut banks; upstream a dark pest wherein our time-sense loses all powers of definition and restless or uneasy fancy conjures up geological periods to hide away an eternally unsolvable riddle, downstream a future even so dark and timeless - such is Spengler's view of human history. Over this surface, there suddenly emerge the forms of the great cultures, organic beings with their own inner necessity and their deep logic of becoming. They go through all the stages of organic life: youth, maturity, decline, and old age. Their youth is a period of infinite yearning in which every action is an augury of things to come and in which art, philosophy, and politics unconsciously embody the cosmic best. In the gradual maturity of growth, the mystery of life is dissipated, its troubles answered, the questions thought through, the great form lost.</p>
<p>Irrevocably over the bodies of a humanity that can no longer but accept, Caesarism approaches, embodying itself in all the traditional trappings of life. Humanity flows into cities, and amidst bread and circuses, amidst a repetition of cataclysmic wars, civilization petrifies and with it disappears not only its outward power but also its inner meaning, of which each culture constructs its own life-symbol. Thus the Greek Gods died with the Classical soul, and so the Western World has started on its slow but certain decline.</p>
<h2 id="spenglers-understanding-of-life">Spengler's Understanding of Life</h2>
<p>Spengler grasped the essential mystery of life that is found in the experience of freedom. He realized that every event represents not only an effect but also an inward experience, the key to results incommensurable with our intentions. He affirmed that there are certain ultimate souls, which no hypothesis can prove and no sophistry can ever deny, expressed in such words as hope, love, beauty, luck, and fear. These are the symbols that are veiled in mystery, and no definition can touch what we feel when we utter these words.</p>
<p>He knew that intuitive perception (the German <em>erfuhlen</em>) contains the key to some mysteries, just as causality reveals the solution to others.</p>
<h2 id="spenglers-experience-in-history">Spengler's Experience in History</h2>
<p>Yet what does Spengler experience in history? An endless unfolding of a cosmic beat that expresses itself in the sole alternatives of subject and object, a vast succession of catastrophic upheavals of which power is not only the manifestation but the exclusive aim; a stimulus of blood that not only pulses through veins but must be shed and will be shed. He feels, in short, only what history also demonstrates phenomenally; he has not experienced the mysteries and thereby derived a level of transcendence; he has solved them and will see in that solution history's only meaning.</p>
<p>"Everything is determined," the devil tells Ivan Karamazov, "and humanity is settled forever. But as, owing to man's inveterate stupidity, this cannot come about for at least a thousand years, everyone who recognizes the truth even now may legitimately order his life as he pleases, on the new principles. In that sense, all things are lawful for him. What's more, even if this period never comes to pass, since there is anyway no God and no immortality, the new man may well become the man-god."</p>
<p>This discloses the true implications of Spengler's position, the dilemma of which is expressed in this striking phrase:</p>
<p>"In the world of history, the Roman caused the Galilean to be crucified - that was his Destiny. In the other world (of Causality and morality), Rome was cast for perdition, and the Cross became the pledge of Redemption that was the Will of God."</p>
<p>But the Cross on the hills of Jerusalem has long disappeared, the temple is in ruins, and the Roman legions are not even a memory. Yet on roadsides all over the world, in the souls of whole civilizations, the Cross still stands. Is that all that is implied by destiny then, this death and that Cross?</p>
<p>This analysis holds true only if one interprets Spengler's philosophy as embodying norms of negativity. Though this is the usual analysis, it is by no means a necessary one.</p>
<p>Toynbee addresses a problem that Spengler never confronted: What causes the emergence, out of formless humanity, of the genus culture?</p>
<p>Toynbee finds the answer in the doctrine of challenge and response. Life presents a series of problems, each a challenge that must be undergone as an ordeal. The initial successful reaction constitutes the civilization's birth. Its growth is not determined by organic necessity but rather occurs through responses to successive challenges. Each solution does not lead to equilibrium but creates an overbalance, which in turn becomes a new challenge. Progress ceases when societies fail to react to new stimuli. A civilization grows through the leadership of a creative minority that directs the majority through mimesis, a social drill, in the absence of direct inspiration. Yet, in every civilization, mimesis eventually breaks down, and the creative minority becomes a dominant minority, substituting force for charm. The progressive differentiation of a civilization results in a dominant minority and an internal proletariat, which is in, but not of, a given society, leading to a stunting of creativity and meaning.</p>
<h2 id="the-role-of-the-internal-proletariat">The Role of the Internal Proletariat</h2>
<p>Culminating in a transcendental knowledge of the unity of mankind through a universal church, the internal proletariat rescues the values of the collapsing society, which are then embodied in the new civilization erected by the victorious external proletariat on the ruins of the old. The decay of civilizations manifests outwardly as a universal state, in which internal schism occurs, followed by a period of contending states, and finally, an apocalyptic emergence of a higher religion as the embodiment of the meaning of history. Toynbee's theory of challenge and response is very similar to Hegel's dialectic. It does not represent a negation of determinism but rather a description of its operation. The analysis of response almost exclusively in terms of challenges lends itself to a more refined interpretation of the environment theory. Since Toynbee attempts to verify theoretical assumptions through empirical methods, success becomes the only criterion of moral fitness. Survival reveals God's sanction to the elect, and history's purpose is identical with man's aspirations.</p>
<p>The unsatisfactoriness of Toynbee's philosophy derives from his methodology, even though his conclusions give an intimation of transcendental experience.</p>
<h2 id="concept-of-transfiguration">Concept of Transfiguration</h2>
<p>The attempt to find a causal realization of divine purpose in the manifestations of political power results in inconsistencies, such as the assertion that the miracle of Christianity will save the West despite the collapse of every other civilization and the fact that, in Toynbee's scheme, universal churches appear as concomitants of disintegration. However, an inward experience cannot be proved by empirical data. A philosophy of history without profound metaphysics will forever juxtapose surface data and can never satisfy the totality of man's desire for meaning.</p>
<p>Spengler had a vision but did not fully press its implications. His intuition of history as experience has pointed the way to the solution of the enigma posed by the experience of freedom and the knowledge of necessity. Kant realized that the phenomenal world is explored in vain for a proof of those ideas, "the possibilities of which no human intelligence will ever fathom, but the truth of which no sophistry will ever wrest from the conviction of even the commonest men." An analysis of historical phenomena reveals the inevitability inherent in completed action: freedom.</p>
<p>On the other hand, this freedom testifies to an act of self-transcendence that overcomes the inexorability of events by infusing them with its spirituality. The ultimate meaning of history--as of life--can only be found within ourselves. What is the content of this transcendental experience? This is not easy to express. When Socrates, in "The Republic," is asked to explain the "Idea of the Good," he replies that it cannot be defined. Man can attain its vision only by analogy, by studying those objects that contain some portion of the ultimate reality, such as beauty, astronomy, and mathematics. Reflection may then lead to a sudden illumination that reveals the transcendental condition of all knowledge.</p>
<p>Dostoevsky has been called "the great criminal." Yet his insight into the depths, and his ability to do so without flinching, rests on a saintly recognition of this transcendence, on an apprehension of the unity of mankind, expressed in the concept of love as the mystical bond of the universe.</p>
<p>"If you love everything," says Father Zosima, "you will perceive the divine mystery of things," and "what grows lives and is alive only through the feeling of its contact with other mysterious worlds. If that feeling is lost, the heavenly growth will die away in you."</p>
<p>And "The Idiot" expresses the longing for a final culmination of all destinies: "What difference can it make if the tension is abnormal, if the result itself, if the moment of sensation, when remembered and examined in the healthy state, proves to be in the highest degrees harmony and beauty; and gives an unheard of and undreamed feeling of completion, of balance, of satisfaction and exultant prayerful fusion with the highest synthesis of life?"</p>
<p>There exist two levels of historical analysis: the empirical, which classifies historical data by its phenomenal appearance and will perforce discover a cyclical pattern, and the ethical, which views history as a key to action. The doctrine of immanent necessity represents the outsider's view of history, the conception of a person who has not experienced the accomplishment of the event. No representation of inevitability can, however, absolve the individual from giving his own meaning to his own existence. Necessity describes the past, but freedom rules the future.</p>
<p>Purposes reveal a task to be achieved, an expression of a soul, not merely an attribute of historical events. The ethical arena depends on the transcendental experience implied by Plato, Kant, or Dostoevsky.</p>
<p>Does this mean that mysticism contains the only key to history, with reason serving as an obstacle to the ultimate determination of the meaning of life? Kant has already answered the question. Morality derives from a mystic relationship to the infinite, a personal experience that elevates man above the realm of necessity. This transcendental experience enables reason to provide rules of general applicability. The categorical imperative is not a law in the ordinary sense but a guide to an action postulated by the experience of freedom. Kant's philosophy of history is an emanation of this transcendence, a corollary that demonstrates the kingdom of ends, where each man is both subject and legislator, the highest concept achieved by the Western view of the dignity of the individual.</p>
<p>What, then, is the relationship between morality and a philosophy of history? The magical attitude can find no such relation and must revert to the "man-god" and a deterministic psychology. Viewing the succession of growth and decay, one might be tempted to agree with Hegel: "Only by consoling ourselves that it would not be otherwise can we accept these enormities." Life does seem like a process of dying; power does seem to be the criterion of values.as its full implication the concept of tolerance, the very basis.</p>
<p>For the dignity of the moral personality of the individual,</p>
<p>Yet a final dilemma emerges. Even though our contemplation of history may yield, as its deepest meaning, a feeling of limits as the basis of the ultimate moral personality of man, we are still faced with the fact that no civilization has yet been permanent, no longing completely fulfilled, and no answer ever gone unchallenged.</p>
<p>It is a difficult question, and one must not reply dogmatically. It is not easy to define what degree of permanence or what hope of apocalyptic fulfillment a value or an attitude requires. Perhaps the experience of living offers a clue. We know we must die and yet live with a sense of eternity. We can never prove that our action, even a second ago, was really freely willed, and yet we entertain no doubt of our freedom as new situations arise. Despite the limits of our lives, we know that our actions are irrevocable and that even inactivity posits an absolute relation. We can live this dilemma only by a measure of acceptance and, despite the knowledge of the transitoriness of our lot, with a mode of permanence. This acceptance is not a fatalistic resignation but an active recognition of limits, which enables man to face and transcend the majesty of the flow of history and the directness of life.</p>
<p>This is the profounder reasoning of Goethe's poem that Spengler chose as the theme of his philosophy.</p>
<p>In the Endless, self-repeating flows forevermore the same. Myriad arches, springing, meeting, hold at rest the mighty frame. Streams from all things love of living, grandest star and humblest clod, all the straining, all the striving is eternal peace in God.</p>
<p><em>Wenn im Unendlichen</em><br />
<em> Sich wiederholend ewig fliesst</em><br />
<em>Das tausendfältig Gewobene</em><br />
<em>Sich kraftvoll ineinanderschliesst,</em><br />
<em>Strömt Lebenslust aus allen Dingen</em><br />
<em>Dem kleinsten, wie dem grossen Stern</em><br />

<h3 id="spengler">Spengler</h3>
<h3 id="introduction">INTRODUCTION</h3>
<p>Spengler denied that history worked towards purposes ascertainable by rational analysis. Progress is a causality imposed by the intellect, man's reaction to the dual qualities of world-longing and world-fear that are the result of his relation as a microcosm to a macrocosm, his knowledge of limits, and the certainty of death.</p>
<p>History contains the problem of motion, the enigma of the ever-unique experience, and the dilemma that forces man not only to observe the movement in a scene but at the same time to participate in that movement. This impossibility of ever observing that which is in the process of observing itself leads to the inner experience of a destiny idea that is lived with absolute certainty by every man of early culture, while the beat of this experience is ever decreasing in the late Megalopolitan.</p>
<p>Destiny represents eternal becoming, the intuitive answer to the question of when, the source and resolution of all of man's hope, and the ultimate realization of inevitability. Causality governs the become, with space as its representation. Becoming and being, space and time, wisdom and intellect, freedom and necessity constitute the true polarities of life, giving rise to man's interpretation of existence either under the aspect of the World-as-history or the World-as-Nature.</p>
<p>The ordering of history into ancient, medieval, and modern periods, the Darwinian theory of evolution, and the concept of...</p>
<h1 id="infinite-human-progress-becomes-equally-meaningless">Infinite Human Progress Becomes Equally Meaningless</h1>
<p>Instead, there emerge the shapes of the great cultures, as the carriers of all the meaning of humanity. Each is a product of the soil in which it grew, awakening in a moment when the fear of death and the longing for life synthesized into a picture of the world from which emerges the Grand Myth, the symbol of all the problems and all the potentialities inherent in the culture. The inward representation of this image is the culture's soul.</p>
<p>Each Culture Has a Determinate Life-Span</p>
<p>Before returning to the biological ages that spawned it in the shape of civilization, a state of absolute finishedness with the problems answered, the style lost. Philosophy of history to Spengler is not a question of industriously adding epochs to epochs, nor of the mere scientific collection of data. Data provides but the raw material, the condition for the higher experience, the physiognomic tact, which illuminates the meaning of the symbols and explains the stages of development. The morphology of history is Spengler's task, one eminently fit for a Faustian (Western) thinker. Cultures are compared in terms of their inner meaning. Their contemporary epochs reveal functions of identical stages in development.</p>
<p>Becoming and becoming, destiny and causality emerge as man's problems at every stage and permeate all his creations: art, the state, religion, economics, and natural sciences. At the end of the road, while Cassarim rules in the Megalopolis and man's dilemmas are thought through to steel-bright sharpness, a moment of realization occurs that, after all, the analogy had not led to its goal, that man holds in his hand nothing but the early myth in another shape. At this point, the second Religiousness comes over mankind, and ideation in the grand style ceases in all fields of activity. The civilization petrifies, and the period of <em>felix-existence</em> as objects to a destiny that is no longer experienced commences.</p>
<p>Since destiny is the representation of the will-to-live, dependent on the self-assurance of its exponent, an analysis of the elements of political success ensues, not in a normative framework of purposive realization but as an answer to the pragmatic problem of prevailing. Prof. von Beckrall rejects Spengler's philosophy as a metaphysical creation, not in the first instance based on empirically verified observations. This misses the essence of an inductive method. Not the existence, but the adequacy of metaphysical concepts, not their exclusive foundation in particular observations, but their applicability to the pervasive nature of experience must be the subject of analysis.</p>
<p>We must further decide how far Spengler is a follower of Hegel despite his attacks on the ascription of rational purposes to history and what was his relation to Darwin, the object of his ridicule and yet the chronicler in the biological world of Spengler's political realm. And so the last question emerges: Is it possible to describe the mere components of political success without imparting into the evaluation of its elements normative concepts? Is it possible to utilize necessity as a# The Insolvable Dilemma of Time Emerges</p>
<p>Each act is unique, yet science must postulate on the endless comparability of phenomena. The world reveals a process of eternal becoming, but causality can operate only on the become. The realm of becoming knows only singularly occurring facts; the world of pure being operates with eternal truths. The conflict of rhythm against tension, destiny against causality, permeates existence and history. Two futures of the world are possible: the World-as-History, in which the become is ordered with reference to the becoming, or the World-as-Nature, in which the opposite occurs.</p>
<p>The World-as-History</p>
<p>"I feel myself driven toward an end that I do not know," Napoleon stated at the beginning of the Russian campaign. "As soon as I shall have reached it, an atom will suffice to shatter me. Yet then not all the forces in the world will prevail against me."</p>
<p>The World-as-Nature</p>
<p>Yet the World-as-Nature, too, has its triumphs. Its linkages represent man's attempt at attaining mastery over his destiny. It can achieve, in its highest form, liberation and freedom from the world-born fear which is the lot of waking consciousness, the Ego's loneliness in the face of impassable boundaries. It is ever the task of religion to fight against the powers of the blood, to withdraw from the world into asceticism, to realize the necessity of tension, and in the end finally to love it.</p>
<p>"Morality is a planned causality of conduct" of eternal validity and, by definition, applicable even if man did not exist. The saint must realize, however, that his victories are not of this world. If he wants temporal success, the logic of events forces him to use political weapons. The meeting of Pilate and Christ constitutes Spengler's poetic representation of this dilemma. The Roman asked, "What is truth?" And in that question expressed the self-confidence of the State, the pride of eminent fitness, the entire meaning of history. The answer, not indeed spoken but implicit in the actions of the prisoner, was: "What is actuality?"</p>
<p>This contains the final differentia between the two form-worlds: between becoming and being, destiny and causality, history and nature. Becoming, with waking consciousness as its subject, or a waking-being that attempts to dominate destiny, are the essence of the antinomy, the real alternatives of life.</p>
<p>The politician despises the thinker and dreamer--and rightly. For the believer, all worldly ambition is sham and deception--he too is right.</p>
<p>"A ruler who attempts to improve religion in the direction of practical, worldly purposes is a fool. A sociologist-preacher who tries to bring peace, forgiveness, righteousness, and peace into the world of actuality is a fool also. His faith has yet altered the world, and no fact can rebut a faith." Let a man be either a hero or a fool.</p>
<h1 id="a-saint-for-between-lies-not-wisdom-but-banality">A Saint, for Between Lies, Not Wisdom, but Banality</h1>
<p>Spengler resolved this dilemma of our experience of freedom and our knowledge of necessity into a postulate of alternatives. The opposition of becoming and being, the tension between destiny and causality, constitutes the metaphysical basis of Spengler's philosophy of history. The actualization of the immanent pulse achieves its highest form as long as its direction is taken for granted. Waking consciousness achieves a gradual dominance only by reducing the lived experience of the cosmic beat. Finally, man is adrift in a world whose purpose is no longer his own. The Culture turns into a Civilization, petrifies, and dies.</p>
<p>Spengler implies that the man of fact lives a destiny and thereby achieves his triumphs. However, this does not seem to prove the dominance of becoming over being, of History over waking consciousness. The recognition of the immanence depends on waking consciousness. Instinct is no guide to political conduct. Effective leadership is always forced--whatever its motives--to represent itself as the carrier of ideas, embodying purposes. All truly great achievements in history resulted from the actualization of principles, not from clever evaluations of political conditions. Only plants are pure pragmatists. The Causality that motivates man is not.</p>
<p>One may, of course, define all actuality as necessary, and then all events become functions of inexorability. See post Conclusions.</p>
<p>Freedom is not derived from the physical world but from a personal, mystic relationship to the Infinite. Conversely, the man of truths, the saint, represents not merely waking consciousness. "To restrain blood, one must have blood," says Spengler, thereby refuting himself. What gives majesty to Christ's thought and driving force to Mohammed is not their logical consistency but their pertinency to the very basis of human longing. Why was Hus burned, and why did Luther split the church? What is the real meaning of the triumph of Christianity? Because the time was ripe, Spengler would answer. Because at that time, the coming of the Messiah, the end of the world, and the longing for the brotherhood of man had obliterated the Classical world-feeling, and thus each man expressed in conversion his own religiousness. Yet does this not mean that self-contained being is no more possible than all-pervasive becoming? Christ may have been like a child in a strange, remote world. Perhaps the sentry under the Cross heard His anguished cry that God had forsaken him. Yet it was not, as Spengler asserts, the sentry who represented the facts of history, but the man on the Cross. It might be maintained, of course, that if Christ had never existed, something like his beliefs would have triumphed in the form of the mystery cults. It is in the "something," however, wherein lies the difference between necessity and freedom, between a tendency and the creative act. No activity, no society is without its motivations, which are given in common experience and understood without affirmation. But equally, common experience will not suffice to predict individual behavior. Every event is not only an effect but an inner experience. Yet the inner experience is not separated from the effect. Destiny may condition causality, but equally, the truths of waking consciousness become the "facta" of history. And so we find that there is no real opposition between being and waking being, only two connected modes of human existence, the organic and the purposive, nothing but our original question in a different form: "What is this necessity that accomplishes itself under the mode of freedom?"</p>
<p>The Development of the Culture</p>
<p>Spengler saw in his metaphysical antinomy the key to the growth and decay of cultures, the essence of their soul, and the basis of politics. Historical development constitutes an organic process, its distinguishing characteristic being the gradual assertion of the power of waking consciousness. The demarcation that distinguishes the relative predominance of the two possible worldviews is that between culture and civilization, the former an expression of the eternal rhythm, the latter a manifestation of a continuously decreasing cosmic beat. Spengler envisioned existence as a biological process that attains meaning only with the emergence of Cultures. Primitive humanity was engaged in a constant struggle for mere survival. The marginal nature of life left no room for profound ideation, only for a transitory religiosity dependent on its supposed power of conjuring the lurking, enigmatic dangers. Suddenly, at approximately 3000 B.C., the forms of the great cultures emerged, organic beings with their own inner conception of destiny. They brought about such a fundamental change that Spengler postulates a transformation in the human constitution. Henceforth, man constructs his world-image, his depth-experience not only with reference to himself but as part of an experienced whole. The degree of inter-relationship of this experience and its lived significance characterizes.</p>
<h1 id="common-membership-in-a-culture">Common Membership in a Culture</h1>
<p>Each Culture constitutes an organic being with growth, maturity, old age, and death. They awaken in a moment of infinite longing when the fear of death, the end of the world, and the dark mystery of the universe oppress everybody's heart. Such was the time when, at the birth of Christ, the Magian soul attained life, when the world was full of tales of a Messiah and the Classical soul was dissipating itself in Neo-Platonism and the oriental mystery cults. This moment also reflects the years 900-1000, when the end of the world seemed near, and out of the confused groping of the Merovingian and Carolingian periods ("Charlemagne as a ray from Baghdad"), the upward-striving soul of the Western (Faustian) culture emerged.</p>
<p>At these moments, in the higher minds of the young culture, the environment suddenly coalesces into a meaningful picture. All the problems and possibilities of future history are already immanent in the formations of those early years, in the construction of its Grand Myth. Each culture begins with a great renunciation, the refusal to take over the symbols of the preceding civilization, and the selection of its appropriate representations. Even if outward manifestations of other cultures are adopted, the very selectivity and the content ascribed will be unique, solitary, and essentially incommunicable to outsiders.</p>
<p>The myth of each Culture contains its image of the world, the essence of its longing, the possibility ofThe man of the higher culture is a need seen as a duty of expressing his essence. The culture grows in a landscape and remains tied to it for the remainder of its existence. In the biological period that precedes the historical era, a peasantry develops that is close to the soil and feels the rhythm of the cosmic beat.</p>
<p>Out of the anonymous countryside, a feudal order develops at the beginning of each culture, whose essence is expressed in a customary ethic. The frame of reference is not good and evil, but good and bad, and whose stigma attaches to vulgarity, not sin. This aristocracy represents the world of facts and the meaning of what is about to happen. The peasantry is history; the aristocracy makes history. A priesthood, too, appears, born out of the world-fear.</p>

<h2 id="a-common-devotion-to-a-concept">A Common Devotion to a Concept</h2>
<p>A set of abstract and critical judgments on the faith that is no longer experienced. Life becomes a comprehended mechanics out of which all Puritans develop predestination as a technical guarantee for the triumph of the elect. Another fifty years pass, and rational criticism alone remains supreme. This leads to the age of the Metropolis, the world-as-city, the acme of a temporarily triumphant waking consciousness. The countryside has long reverted to its biological state. It gazes on the strange creation of human art with uncomprehending hatred. Such is the feeling of Dostoevsky towards St. Petersburg, which he felt "could vanish one day with the morning mist." All the thought and decisions of life are concentrated in the Cosmopolis. The spirit of the city is coldly practical.</p>
<h2 id="philosophy-frees-itself">Philosophy Frees Itself</h2>
<p>From its dependence on religion and submits the whole universe, including religion, to epistemological criticism. "In the period of growth, we re-evaluated itself; the city-period has life as an object." It is symbolized by the deep spirituality of Pascal against the shallow utilitarianism of Mill. Life is no longer lived as something self-evident but becomes a problem of maximum happiness. Each culture develops at this stage its own mode of spiritual extinction.</p>
<p>The Apollonian Soul</p>
<p>Its ideal pure body, with the opposition of Ent and Non-Ent, its tragedy of the senseless incident buffeting man by the blind threads of Tyche; with the hero's only possibility consisting of the grand gesture, develops Stoicism, a purging of the soul of whatever is alien to it, so that it emerges in its pure statuesque bodiliness. The Western will-to-power, its expression ever a commanding imperative, completes the materialization of its soul by the mechanistic solution of Stoicism. Philosophy in the great style is finished.</p>
<p>No great thinkers developed in the Classical period after the Stoics, and Western thought has been stated in its final form by Kant.</p>
<p>The 19th Century Accomplished</p>
<p>Was the mechanization of its concepts in the spirit of a utilitarian will-to-life. Formerly profound thinking was associated with mathematics; now it becomes socio-political. The metaphysics of the Baroque develops into the critique of society of Hegel, Schopenhauer, and Nietzsche. Ultimately, man yearns for a return to Nature.</p>
<p>It is not the landscape of early Gothic, however, but the conceptual definition of Rousseau, the natural relation of Marx.</p>
<p>Kant had a vision of the world as appearance or phenomena, but to Schopenhauer, it is merely a brain-phenomenon with utilitarian connotations. The change from the tragic view to the plebeian, from the felt intuition of Goethe and the inward necessity of Shakespeare, to the pragmatic perspective of Marx is complete.</p>
<p>"Poets build but no longer sing; shapes are called into being not to be--but to prove something." The Darwinian theory of evolution, which imports the Manchester School theories into the world of destiny and replaces the inward harmony of the Gothic with the mechanistic conception of aims called progress, is the necessary product of that period.</p>
<p>But every deeper thinker of the 19th Century is socialistically defined by Spengler as the imposition of one's views on behalf of all, "with attention directed towards that welfare of mankind that Goethe and Kant never spent a moment's thought on." <em>Frances of Spengler op. cit. Vol. I. p. 393</em>.</p>
<h2 id="assisi-and-the-saints-of-the-cultures-youth">Assisi and the Saints of the Culture's Youth</h2>
<p>The Socialist conceives only of distributing temporal possession. Art, too, has become formless. The early religious self-assurance, the great style which represented a rhythm of self-implementation, is becoming ever less well defined, and the self-consciousness ever greater.</p>
<p>To Michelangelo, Leonardo, Rembrandt, Bach, and Beethoven, the great style was an aid; the schools of art produced a high average. It liberated the artist from struggling with form, enabling him to pour the essence of his soul into the creation. But with Wagner and Pergolesi, the style is felt as a hindrance. Everything becomes huge, ever more esoteric and abstract in the Western, ever more ornate and hovering in the Apollonian Culture.</p>
<p>Finally, the great style is lost, and instead of ideas, there are continually new art problems coaxed out of an inwardly meaningless creativeness. Instead of a school, the only criterion is taste. Natural science had begun by dissecting the religious world picture, both a product of man's astonishment at the motion of his universe and an attempt to dominate the inexorability of fate. The intellect ever thinks that it has mastered truths of eternal applicability, but it cannot rest until every question has been answered and no riddle remains.</p>
<p>Yet since nature is what man constructs for himself out of his depth experience, that which we are observing lives with us in the process of observation. Moreover, every scientific result is the consequence of a method, and the method presupposes ae, the old enigmas reappear. That which had brought natural science to a maximum of inner fulfillment suddenly operates as a solvent. Each culture discovers that the ultimate questions are unanswerable causally; the problem of motion remains unresolved.</p>
<p>Force, as the source or the cause of motion, represents the Western dilemma, while the perfect form of substance and the causality of its movement embody the Classical perspective. The hypothesis grows progressively more abstract and inclusive as the various fields of knowledge converge ever closer. In a moment of painful clarity, it becomes apparent that amidst all the abstruseness, the ever sharper definition of conceptual quantities, which moreover like the concept of Force determine the structure of the experiment a priori, emerges nothing but the myths of springtime in modern society.</p>
<p>Then, in the grey light of the beginning of civilization, man realizes that the tension created by his waking consciousness has become too great, that the quest for knowledge is without end, and his tired soul plunges into the peace of the Second Religiousness. Yet where the early religion was the grand symbolism of an emerging soul, the citizen of the metropolis, with the cosmic beat in him ever decreasing, clings desperately to his cults, his Theosophy, and his religious fads.</p>
<p>In the Springtime, reason was felt as a support of faith; in maturity, faith was conceived as subject to critical analysis, and an enlightened waking consciousness sought to find its own position towards life (Weltanschauung). Now, however, faith alone is the criterion. The flight from reason prevails, accompanied by the belief that there exists some mystic constitution of actuality, of which formal proofs are barren.</p>
<p>As the Culture Turns Itself into a Civilization</p>
<p>As the masses of the world-city seek to find release from the polarities in their soul through panem et circenses, in dances and sports, Caesarism emerges in the political organization, replacing democracy, which has become an empty shell, and ending the dictatorship of money, which is by now the real master of political life.</p>
<p>It represents the eventual triumph of the blood, of being, over the strained waking consciousness of the Megapolis. Pure power, the coursing rhythm of ever-becoming, reasserts itself; and despite traditional trappings, even because of them, a formless force permeates all aspects of political life. Nothing, according to Spengler, can save the dying civilization. The sterility of all late man ensues, leading to a metaphysical turn towards death.</p>
<p>The tragic symbolism, which in Shakespeare could lift an incident into a destiny, has in Ibsen become the problematization of social events. Woman, whom the man of the Springtime culture conceives as the mother of his children, constitutes for the Cosmopolitan a companion for life, an object for the blending of dispositions.</p>
<p>No attempt, however frantic, can arrest the decline in population. Neither the marriage laws of Augustus, nor the wholesale adoptions, nor the incessant implantation of barbarians could check this process in the Hellenic world.</p>
<p>"When reasons have to be put forward in a question of life, life itself has become problematical." The animal element, the strained waking consciousness, has consumed the plant side, and the drive into the future, which binds together a sequence of generations into a purposeful organism, is at an end. The population returns to a fellah-type state, akin to the Egyptians at the time of the Romans and the Chinese and Indians today. Here, all growth has ceased, and the biological sequence of generations, with millennia for time-span, re-emerges. Waking consciousness has succeeded in stiffening the becoming, in petrifying the great symbolism. As in the living Culture, the state and race are in antithesis as the impersonal and the personal; so in the fellah-state, the opposition is between the mass and the caste, as the formal against the formless. The intellectuality, subtlety, and dignity of this form-world may be considerable, as attested by the heights from which an Indian looks down on a Westerner. But history has ceased for the Civilization. It has become an object for Cultures and peoples who will to be a destiny, and the period of contending States has left it physically and morally exhausted.</p>
<p>"And so high history lays itself down weary to sleep. Man becomes a plant again, adhering to the soil, dumb and enduring. The timeless village and the eternal peasant reappear, begetting children and burying in Mother Earth--a busy, not inadequate swarm, over which the tempest of soldier-emperors passingly blows. In the midst of the land lie the old world-cities, empty receptacles of an extinguished soul, in which a historyless mankind slowly nests itself. Men live from hand to mouth, with petty thrifts and petty fortunes, and endure. Masses are trampled on in the conflict of the conquerors who contend for the power and the spoil of this world, but the survivors fill the gap with primitive fertility and continue to suffer.</p>
<p>And while in high places there is the eternal alternation of victory and defeat, those in the depths pray, pray with that mighty piety of the Second Religiousness that has overcome all doubts forever. There, in the souls, world-peace, the peace of God, the bliss of grey-haired monks and hermits has become actual--and there alone. It has awakened that depth in the endurance of suffering, which the historical man, in the thousand years of his development, has never known. Only with the end of grand History does holy, still being reappear. It is a drama noble in its sameness, noble and aimless as the course of the stars, the rotation of the earth, and the alternance of land and sea, of ice and virgin forest upon its face. We may marvel at it, or we may lament it--but it is there.</p>
<p>Spengler rejected the theory that history revealed the causal working out of rational plans. He substituted a morphology of history, the world as experience, evoked by images of compelling power and great inward beauty. Cultures are or--</p>
<h1 id="sanisms-their-life-span-extent-and-death">Sanisms, Their Life-Span, Extent, and Death</h1>
<p>Implicit in the very problems of their youth.</p>
<p>Though everything organic has its periods of youth, growth, and decay, these phenomena do not embody themselves in identical forms. The statement "Western History was willed and Classical history happened" means nothing if we postulate the necessity of a political development that has the same political organization at each stage.</p>

<h1 id="survival">Survival</h1>
<p>The knowledge of the macrocosm as a technical and empirical mastery is the World-as-Nature. Beyond the environment, man divines the presence of a <em>something other</em> in both himself and others, which, by virtue of its physiognomically impressive powers, evokes the desire to know and is anxiously pondered.</p>
<p>Thus, the notion of the soul arises as an image of everything in man that can never be causally known, as a counterworld to nature, as a mode of visualizing what will always be inaccessible by the light-world of the eye. The soul's representation reflects Spengler's metaphysical scheme. Its image is a myth pondered religiously by the spirituality that still sees God in nature and analyzed conceptually as soon as nature comes to be observed critically. Just as Time constitutes a counter-concept to Space, so the notion of a soul is the inverse of the picture of the world.</p>
<p>"Every psychology becomes a counter-physics." This prevents an exact science of the soul, of universal applicability, since such an analysis is a function of the depth experience of its culture. The Apollinian constructed its inner world as a group of excellent parts. The Western thinker conceives his image as forces of thinking, feeling, and willing. The Magian psychologist views his soul as an airy substance (<em>nepesh</em>, <em>ruach</em>) in conjunction with a bodily substance, both deriving reality only from an infusion of the divine <em>pneuma</em>.</p>
<p>Spengler defines the image of the soul as the possible and the world as the actual. Thus, life is the process of actualizing the possible, with the history of each culture constituting a ripening and deepening of its soul-picture. This accounts for the profound symbolism of all manifestations of activity of culture and the complete lack of inner meaning of every creation of both the primitive and fellah state.</p>
<p>Since the waking consciousness arrives at self-knowledge through the experience and fear of death, the rites of burial and the disposal of bodies serve as profound indications of the depth-experience of different cultures. Because all art is an expression of world-longing and all natural science an analysis of the religious world-picture, the grand symbolism of the culture includes all their manifestations, with the proviso that maturity and decline will see a diminution of the cosmic beat, its emanations becoming more uncertain and inconclusive until the inevitable approach of the fellah state at the end of civilization.</p>
<p>The Classical or Apollinian Soul</p>
<p>The Classical or Apollinian soul conceived of existence as exhausting itself in a pure present against the background of the Golden Age. Its passionate denial of infinity came to expression at its inception in the great refusal to take over the form-world and architectural style of the Minoan world. Suddenly, about 1100 B.C., with the emergence of the Mycenaean culture, great architecture ceased. The barrow for the burial of the dead was supplanted by the burning of the corpses. Wood replaced stone as building material despite an abundance of quarries in Hellas. Existence consists of a denial of infinity, emphasizing pure being.</p>
<p>Thucydides states in his <em>History of the Peloponnesian War</em> that before the year 400, his time,</p>
<h1 id="not-much-of-importance-had-happened-in-greece">Not Much of Importance Had Happened in Greece</h1>
<p>Life in the Apollonian world constituted a spiritual static. The Greek word for personality is "persona," which does not express the concept of character but describes the public man, the "gesture" of its bearer. The ideal of the Classical was Cosmos, the perfectly defined, absolute Being, in opposition to which space was felt not as a challenge but as Non-Being, Chaos, the not-yet-formed. The self-asserting Ego of Western culture, or its forceful, all-pervasive God, would have been equally alien to the Apollonian world-feeling.</p>
<p>Man, as a body, achieves reality through his relation to other bodies, with the Gods as the upper limit and the slave as the lower. This explains Aristotle's statement that only a fool of a God could live alone and makes the idea of an existence without relation to others seem absurd.</p>
<p>Content to review: gratuitously destroyed. Spiritual characterization was prevented by the wearing of masks and the padding of figures, making movement almost impossible.</p>
<p>Classical architecture was ever forced to fight against the assertiveness of pure being, which it threatened by the implication of permanence inherent in building. This gave rise to the Classical temple, characterized by an extreme poverty of form, since the recognition of many styles would have been an admission of a type of infinity. Its columns of uneven spacing, its accentuation of beam and load, and its flat roof all served as a denial of space and an affirmation of the exclusive validity of the present.</p>

<p>Its tragedy was the senseless incident. However, the culture of Shakespeare, who elevates the incident into a token of destiny, views manifestations as symbols and judges them not by their truth, but by their ever-changing trueness, their aptness in the flux of eternal becoming in which it will be the fate of his culture, too, to die.</p>
<h2 id="pseudo-morphosia">Pseudo-Morphosia</h2>
<p>"In a rock stratum, crystals of a mineral are embedded. Clefts and cracks occur, water filters in, and the crystals are gradually washed out so that, in due course, only their hollow mold remains. Then come volcanic outbursts that explode the mountain; molten masses pour in, stiffen, and crystallize out in their turn. But these are not free to do so in their own special form. They must fill up the spaces that they find available. Thus, there arise distorted forms--crystals whose inner structure contradicts their external shape--stones of one kind presenting the appearance of another kind. This phenomenon mineralogists call <em>Pseudomorphosia</em>.</p>
<p>Historical <em>pseudo-morphosis</em>, as defined by Spengler, is the process in which an alien culture hangs so heavily over the birthplace of a young culture that the latter cannot attain its own inner development. Its spirituality is forced into strange forms, which are infused with new meaning but also serve to stifle the inner drive of the culture's youth. Such cultures can only look upon the strange form with all-consuming hatred, spending their latent creativity in halfhearted efforts, ever ready to burst through the fetters in a violent orgy. Such was the case of Petrine Russia, which accepted a dynastic form of government in imitation of a culture from which it was inwardly remote. Only the formless power of the early Romanovs could have succeeded in guiding this young soul, which felt the large cities as effervescent illusions and remained a peasantry longing for the soil, no matter how large the cosmopolis. Thus, no aristocracy developed that embodied a destiny; only a senseless aping of alien practices emerged. The intelligentsia grew up as an adjunct to the Court, ever bent on discovering problems that were not felt against the background of the peasantry, which mixed a hatred for the alien form stifling the culture with a disgust for its own overgrowth.</p>
<p>Dostoevsky, the peasant, and Tolstoy, the man of Western society, represent this opposition; the former could never, in his soul, get away from the land, while the latter, in spite of his desperate efforts, could never get near it. Tolstoy is the spokesman of Petrinism--even in his denial. His rejection of society is intellectual; his hatred of property is based on economics. His very inability to shake off the West leads to his hatred of all existing forms, and he therefore becomes the true precursor of Bolshevism. For Bolshevism is merely the rebellion of the lowest strata of Petrine society, which has often spoken of Christ but, in its heart, meant Marx. It represents the final debasement of the metaphysical.</p>
<p>Dostoevsky is the true enemy of this upheaval.</p>
<p>The Magian Soul</p>
<p>Spengler's symbol for the Magian world image is a manifestation of the future of Russia. All agitation about social reform and technical schemes for world betterment remains equally meaningless to him. Just as Christ, he would have felt no difference between working for one's own material benefit or the mere social betterment of others. For how can Communism and the agony of the now coexist? Dostoevsky embodies the destiny of Russia, a victim of the least stages of its Pseudomorphosis, the forms of which are ever filled with the deep spirituality of the boundless plain and which will be swept away, just as its predecessor, without hatred, by the inner logic of the actualization of the Russian soul.</p>
<p>So it was with the Magian soul, which grew up in the forms of the Classical after Actium. All the mystic longing of that East, where strange tales of a Messiah were current, which felt the existence of an immanent God--a Yahweh, Ahura Mazda, or Marduk-Baal--with the certainty of an apocalypticid not acknowledge a cult but established a new community. Long before this, the spirit of the East had permeated Roman institutions, symbolized by the transfer of the capital to Byzantium and the Divus cult, which made the Roman Emperors the first Caliphs.</p>
<p>Yet the spirit of the West was that of a civilization, cold and highly conceptualized. The direction of Christianity under the guidance of Paul, who preached in the cities, remained ever aloof from the apocalyptic feeling of the countryside in the East. The attempt to conceptually define the Logos idea led to the violent secession of the Monophysites and Nestorians.</p>
<p>When Islam appeared, it was greeted as a liberator by the spirit that recognized its own inner essence and spread with the rapidity of a soul that was robbed of its youth and felt its time was limited.</p>
<h1 id="a-cavern-filled-with-dim-light">A Cavern, Filled with Dim Light</h1>
<p>In the uneasy tensions of waking consciousness, the opposition of becoming and being, which the Classical conceived as being and load, and the Faustian felt as force and mass, consists for the Magian of an unsure swaying of substantial realities. Up and down, heaven and earth are substances that contend with one another in a cosmos revolving around the Divine. Death is not the end of life but a death substance that struggles with a life-substance for the mastery of man.</p>
<p>Out of this basic yearning, with man as the theater of battles between the powers of darkness and evil, emerges the Concept of God the Divine Mediator, who transforms this state from torment into bliss. Man consists of a soul and body, both different modes of the same substance, deriving their reality and participating in the light only through the infusion of the Divine Pneuma, which serves as the condition for the heroic deeds of a Samson, the holy wrath of Elijah, and the enlightenment of Solomon. This infusion of the divine into the bodies of the faithful binds the community of believers into a consensus and makes it at one with the enigmatic power above.</p>
<p>Thus, man as body and soul belongs to himself alone. But at the same time, he contains something else, something higher, an emanation of God, which precludes error but also renders a self-asserting Ego totally meaningless. Will and thought are not prime phenomena but already manifestations of the divine in man. God is immanent in every manifestation of phenomenal appearance, the one Cause immediately underlying all visible workings.</p>
<p>Magian science concerns itself with apprehending the substance that appears in different modes in actuality, with purging it of its "foreign" element, with alchemy. Time, too, is cavern-like. The thrusting outward into infinity of the Faustian soul develops into the divine plan for salvation, into the essence of which any inquiry constitutes profanation.</p>
<p>The Magian soul first identified the story of the world with the history of man, into inexorable stages of world-beginning, world-development, and a world catastrophe, which contains the sanction of the moral history of humanity. The operation of the autocratic will precludes not only individual causes and effects but also denies any necessary relation between sin and punishment, any claim to reward for virtue. Man's reality consists of his participation in the divine pneuma, which, after its infusion, allows only will-less resignation (Islam = resignation) into the mysterious working out of God's plan.</p>
<p>"Magian man received Grace, but did not acquire it." Job is the Magian Faust.</p>
<h1 id="three-emanations-of-the-divine">Three Emanations of the Divine</h1>
<p>Three emanations of the divine occur: God, the Word of God, and the Spirit of God. The consensus of the faithful, imbued with the Spirit of God, is beyond the possibility of deception. <em>"My people can never agree in error,"</em> said Mohammed. This explains the early church council, which the West, in its reevaluation of all things Magian, transformed into a political concept for the limitation of a dynamic Papacy.</p>
<p>The God-as-Word represents the substantial infusion of the divine into the sacred texts. This form of Revelation is the rule in the Magian religion. The only change that an unalterable Koran permits is commentary, leading to the development of an exegesis with mystical underpinnings, the Halakah of which the Gospels in early Christianity and the Talmud of Judaism are examples.</p>
<h2 id="separation-of-church-and-state">Separation of Church and State</h2>
<p>A separation of Church and state is impossible in Magian culture. The consensus is itself a church, and its law, found in the sacred book, is the only idea of nationality open to the believers. The development of a strong priesthood is precluded. Man stands in direct relation to the divine in so far as he participates in the pneuma; beyond that, nothing avails. The true priest of Magian culture is the hermit, and the true bliss of its religion is ecstasy when the soul is at one with God and the dark forces of materiality are defeated.</p>
<p>Until the coming of Islam, this Magian world had to live under the forms of the Classical, which it gradually infused with its own spirituality. The pillars of the temple moved inside the mosque; a cupola replaced the flat roof, giving the impression of space, but a space enclosed in the cave. A window in the roof let in dim light that, reflected from the cold ground walls, created an atmosphere of fairy-land unreality, the scene for the operation of an omnipotent, ever-present God. Such was St. Sophia and the Pantheon in Rome.</p>
<p>This is also the world of Spinoza, whose causa sui represents the immanent Deity, and to whom inner certainty was the only criterion of knowledge. The geometric method represents merely a manifestation of Western Pseudomorphosis. It is the world that Christ knew and that Faustian religion can scarcely comprehend. It petrified around 800 and, since the Crusades, has persisted in the fellah-state of unchanging dogmatism and creative impotence.</p>
<p>Spengler's metaphors on the forms of the soul are deeply suggestive, yet they rest on an intuition striving for absolutes, ever expressing itself in the crudest possible manner. His evocation of the souls of the cultures is of a persuasiveness that makes abstract criticism appear dogmatic. Still, one must ask whether he was not describing tendencies instead of unchangeable relations. Achilles is hardly a body placed in a position he did not choose, nor does the Iliad assume indeed the very essence of its tragedy.</p>
<p>Polybius, moreover, wrote a philosophy of history that compares favorably with many creations of the "historical" Faustian Culture, and the scheme of which is very similar to Spengler's concepts of gradual, inevitable degeneration.</p>
<p>Spinoza may be a product of the Magian soul, but Friedrichardly be maintained that this outpouring of spirituality was not itself influenced by the forms it used. The superimposition of a ripe dogma, of the universality of law on an essentially primitive community, undoubtedly permeated the later history of what was significantly called the "Holy Roman Empire German by Nation."</p>
<p>Spengler himself has shown how the forms of language determine the structure of cognition, rendering the equation meaningless unless expressed in words. How much more strongly must the transfer of a high legal tradition and a profound philosophy have affected a nascent culture? Similarly, the dynamic stage of each culture seems to involve a radiation of its influence in art, religion, and political form over neighboring societies, as Eduard Meyer and Toynbee demonstrate. Conversely, the border regions are never free from foreign influence, particularly during periods of decline. The British influence on India has proved significant regardless of the adaptation parliamentary government may eventually receive. The infusion of new meaning into established forms cannot be equivalent to original creation.</p>
<p>To be sure, at times, Spengler recognizes this. He speaks of the effect of Christianity on a soul already predisposed to reverence. He regrets the shackles imposed by Classical mathematics on Western science until Descartes. He expresses gratification about the fortuitous circumstance that freed Western painting through the loss of almost all classical fresco art. But what does "fortuitous" mean in such a context? Is it not a recognition of the interrelationship of cultures, an admission of a continuation of certain forms that, moreover, condition their user? Spengler fails to explain just what factor underlies any continuity of ideation or how the selection of symbols is accomplished.</p>
<p>The metaphysical opposition between becoming and being, the assertion of the ultimate supremacy of Time over Space, forms the basis of Spengler's political theory.</p>
<p>Just as the development of culture constitutes an organic growth characterized by the gradual dominance of a waking consciousness doomed to self-destruction, so politics exhibits an eternal conflict between blood and concept, tradition and dogma. The aging of the culture is accompanied by the decline of that sureness of political form which signifies a mature organism. Mere interest replaces the earlier subordination to an all-embracing idea, and money supplants tradition as the motive force. At each stage, however, the race aspect of life triumphs over its causal representation, first in the victory of economic over abstract political systems and finally in the emergence of the naked power of Caesarism.</p>
<p>Spengler considers politics as the essence of life, manifested in a will for survival, with its criterion being self-assurance. This permits only the choice between victory and ruin, not between war and peace. He distinguishes two aspects in the destiny side of life: the preserving and the mastering, symbolized by the separation of the sexes. The woman represents history and the life of the race; the man makes history. The woman accepts only with difficulty that other history which takes her song from her, while the man experiences a conflict of duties between the public and private manifestations of the State.</p>
<h2 id="destiny">Destiny</h2>
<p>Destiny, the sword and the spindle side of being, the State or the Family emanation of directional Time. Property, too, as a trait of race, belonging to History and reduced to a concept only with the advent of the Cosmopolis, exhibits this duality. It is expressed in the twin attributes of possession:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Having</th>
<th>Type</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Having as power</td>
<td>Power</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Having as booty</td>
<td>Booty</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>From the feeling of power stems conquest, politics, and law; from that of booty derives trade, spoil, and money. This explains the superiority of money over dogma in the constitutional struggle of early civilization. However, the emergence of money as the dominant form heralds a decline of political vitality.</p>
<p>Spengler argues that all success in history, war, and in that continuation of war by other means called politics, has been the product of unities that found themselves "in form." A being is "in form" in the same sense as the term is used in sports. When athletes are in form, the ease of their performance hides the difficulty of their acts. A style that has become second nature signifies an art period "in form." A political unit is in condition when its tradition breeds a high average, enabling it to dispense with great men, whose incidental appearance frequently does more harm than good by the void their death leaves in the flow of events.</p>
<p>Since it belongs to Time, a mere description of constitutional provisions cannot explain the state's essence, which truly expresses the nation in the struggle for existence. The more expressions of conventions and practices exist, the more silent the constitution becomes for their being taken for granted. For Spengler, world history is state-history and not class-history.</p>
<p>Political leadership always belongs to a small minority possessing the instinct of statesmanship and represents naturally the internal arrangements of the state. The surer they adapt themselves to crisis situations, the more effective they are. The inner constitution of a nation must always aim at readiness for the outer fight, involving the management of internal opposition by the ruling stratum in such a fashion that the energies of the nation do not exhaust themselves in party conflicts.</p>
<h2 id="treason">Treason</h2>
<p>Not to be thought of as a last resort. Foreign policy is the ultimate criterion of domestic fitness. The private and public aspects of the destiny-idea are symbolized in each culture by a peasantry which is history and a society which makes it and comes to consciousness of itself only against the background of a peasantry.</p>
<p>It organizes itself as Estates, of which only two have symbolic significance. Nobility and Priesthood constitute Spengler's symbols for the antinomy of becoming and being, Destiny and causality, Time and space. The nobility represents the cosmic, the eternal flow of events, the exclusive validity of the deed. Its educational ideal is training (Zucht), acquired only by living in an environment and a customary ethics which bases itself on its self-evident existence, not on its truth. The priesthood serves as the mediator to the enigmatic and constitutes the symbol of the eternally possible. Its education consists of shaping (Bildung), dependent on studies and a moral of eternal validity. A ripe nobility exhibits finished living, while the highly developed Priesthood possesses that dignity of bearing which denies mere actuality as unessential. "Celibacy excludes the priesthood from history and its character indelibly from time."</p>
<p>The early political organization of feudalism is based on the Estates, with its hierarchy of orders viewing the king merely as a primus inter pares. The ruler possesses subjects only insofar as they owe allegiance to a vassal of his. Private law serves as the bond of union, and a customary ethics stresses honor and loyalty. The two sides of property are here united. The Norman conquests, though consequences of a dynamic world-feeling, the outpouring of a soul that felt the infinite as a challenge, were nevertheless managed with prudent calculation typified by the Domesday Book of England and the financial arrangements of Frederick II.</p>
<p>The Development of the Nation-State</p>
<p>The development of the nation-state is a symptom of the emerging dominance of the cities. The city spirit is practical, valuing objects by their utility and being incapable of living a tradition. The unity of the Third Estate results from its opposition to the political dominance of the nobility. The age of conceptual controversy about liberty begins. Freedom for the emancipated understanding of the city is always freedom "from" something, the ever finer subtilizing of what should be an inner experience. In the Baroque, the First Tyrannies' political controversy was the manifestation of the pulse of breeding, but the Third Estate constitutes merely a community of waking consciousness among the educated, whose numina are systems elaborated with an eye to their inner consistency, without regard to their pertinency. But "the effects of truths are always different from their tendency."</p>
<p>Abstract money appears divorced from the value of the land. Its concern with freedom is merely as a tool for achieving political dominance. It does not ask for public opinion but attempts to form it. Its interest is not the franchise but electioneering, not party membership but the party machine. The power and booty outlook separate in the nobility, as do cult and learning in the priesthood. The history of all "Late Cultures" exhibits a ceaseless struggle of money against law, of intellect against tradition. But money belongs to the world of facts, and intellect to the realm of truths, with inevitable consequences. "Intellect rejects money directs" characterizes the last phases of each culture. The tragic irony of this period resides in the fact that the theorists of freedom are, in the final analysis, only assisting money to be effective. At the end of this development stands Napoleonism.</p>
<h2 id="spenglers-observations-on-england">Spengler's Observations on England</h2>
<p>Spengler finds in England the laboratory in which both sides of Third-Estate politics--the ideal and the real--graduated. Here the Fronde triumphed, allowing the bourgeoisie to grow up in the strong forms of the First Estate, which disarmed it with its inner superiority and never allowed training to be substituted for breeding in the development of its tradition.</p>
<p>Basing its actions on the self-evidence of England's greatness, it substituted the absolutism of class delegation for the absolutism of the State, which in Britain never attained the symbolism of an inward idea. Its place was taken by "society," as the symbol of the nation being "in form" under the class regime; a word that, in the French rationalists, became the vehicle for the expression of their hatred of authority.</p>
<p>In England, however, authority was well defined. It resided in Parliament, which, as a creation of the Baroque, embodied the cosmic flow of the Culture's maturity and therefore had music in it. The genealogical principle was represented by the upper stratum of society, which divided itself according to the relative predominance of the power or the booty outlook into a "respectable" and a "fashionable" party. Though the State's care for all was replaced by a frank assertion of class interest, the organization of the major parties remained significant.</p>
<p>The Parliamentary style represented the British equivalent of Cabinet diplomacy. On the other hand, there was never any confusion between intellectual concepts and practical politics. <em>The successful utilization of the bourgeois catchwords in politics presupposes the shrewd eye of a ruling class for the intellectual constitution of the stratum that intends to attain power but will not be capable of wielding it when attained. Consequently, in England, the generations of </em>free* opinion were most highly developed by the press and political campaigns, as well as Parliament, which were systematically managed.</p>
<p>It was different on the Continent. There, the two sides of liberalism--freedom from the restrictions of soil-bound life, freedom of the intellect for all criticism, and freedom of money for any business activity--operated as a solvent of all form. The distrust of authority felt by the Third Estate was so great that it was ready to assure its freedom by means of a dictatorship. This represents the panic felt by any multitude that no longer feels itself <em>in condition</em>. The waking consciousness of which has so dominated the destiny aspect that it is ready to salvage its inner cohesiveness by submission to an authority that would never be tolerated if legitimate. This is the essence of the second Tyranny--of Alexander, of Napoleon. The self-evident basis for new creativeness has disappeared, and naked power becomes the criterion for success.</p>
<p>Out of the depths of the Megalopolis emerges, at this stage, in Rome and in Paris, a formless mass that expresses itself no longer as mere opposition to traditional values but is the very embodiment of nihilistic power--to which various languages attach equally contemptuous labels: Gansille, Pöpel, Kob. Its influence is out of proportion to its numbers, since it is always present, forcing its way into the forefront of events and overshadowing all political activity by its threat. The bourgeoisie henceforth risks its inner cohesiveness at any moment, both because of its smaller effective numbers, the absence of a positive guiding idea, and the inferiority of its determination. The fear of the mass causes a turn by the Third Estate at the beginning of each Civilization to a constitutional monarchy, of which the most extreme form is the Republic. Here, in the Estate-state, the British model could be copied to advantage.</p>
<p>Two inner contradictions ever harassed the nineteenth-century parliamentary state: the genealogical principle was of such strength that it saw in the state an embodiment of a dynasty that no longer existed, and the cold intellect that only recognized the perfect form of government. This again symbolized the opposition of Time, Space, becoming, and being. *While in England the parties were distinguished by their possession of different though well-tested modes of government, on the Continent the criterion was the direction towards which the Constitution was to be changed--tradition or theory. In this context, it was forgotten that foreign policy is the ultimate standard of inward fitness. The domestic and diplomatic services developed in opposite directions, and the real victor of the dilemma was abstract money. This involves the reason for the decay of democracy. The Third Estate attains political effectiveness as a party to which one adheres because of agreement with its conceptual program but to which one does not inwardly belong.</p>
<h2 id="rrr-so-neng-fn-eel-en-ee-rps-nsn-so-eat-2-ven-ses-s-rrr-so-neng-fn-eel-en-ee-rps-nsn-so-eat-2-ven-ses-s">RRR So Neng FN eel EN ee RPS NSN So eat 2 ven SES S## RRR So Neng FN eel EN ee RPS NSN So eat 2 ven SES S</h2>
<p>The eventual degeneration into interest groups entails the disappearance of the cohesiveness of the bourgeoisie, following the elimination of the political eminence of the First Estate. For democracy to function as intended by its theorists, it requires the almost total absence of interested leadership. Yet, a tendency that has once embodied itself in political form not only motivates parties but also becomes their tool.</p>
<p>"At first, parties came into existence for the sake of the program; then they are held on to defensively as a tool for power and booty. Finally, the program is forgotten, and the organization exists for its own sake." This, Spengler calls Caesarism--the dominance of formless power.</p>
<p>Thus, the rights of the people and the influence of the people must be sharply differentiated, according to Spengler. Indeed, the influence of the electorate varies inversely with the degree of universality of the franchise. The people's fundamental right to choose its own representatives is, in practice, denied, as every fully developed organization recruits itself.</p>
<p>The effective control of politics reverts to the party leadership, with its capabilities determined by the availability of money. Money emerges as the dominating force in the final stages of democracy. Elections require funds, and public opinion must be made amenable through campaigns. In this phase, the free formation of public opinion becomes impossible.</p>
<p>The Press becomes an independent force, manipulating minds through the constant repetition of party slogans, suppressing hostile or financially ineffective criticism by its Conspiracy of Silence, and forestalling the potential adverse effects of occasional books by reviewing them. This is magnified by the particular dynamism of Faustian man, who, even in Scholasticism, achieved a willed unity that allowed no hostile criticism.</p>
<p>The dictatorship of the party machines supports itself on the Press. Election campaigns become civil wars fought with the ballot. "We preserve the form even if it contradicts the advantage," forms the theoretical basis of democracy, but this is exactly what the non-Estate finds itself incapable of doing.</p>
<p>Gradually, the feeling grows that the Constitution contains no effective guarantees, and the rights for which grandparents died cease to be meaningful to their descendants. People become tired of the gleaming concepts and turn to the release afforded by the Second Religiousness.</p>
<p>The political form-world has been thought to completion, and Destiny begins to reassert itself over dogmatic causality. The West has produced no political theorist capable of reaching the souls since Marx. Democracy, therefore, represents not a summit of achievement but an inevitable stage on the road from Napoleonism to that of Caesarism, which for the last time concentrates within itself all that remains of blood, dynastic feeling, and the idea of the State.</p>
<h1 id="state">State</h1>
<p>The period of Caesarism is preceded by an age of gigantic conflict--the "period of Contending States"--lasting from Alexander to Caesar in the Classical and beginning with Napoleon in the West. This epoch exhibits in crescent shape the opposition between the great form and the great individual. The loss of the felt relation to the cosmic beat opens opportunities for private individuals who will have power at any price and who, as embodiments of force, can shape the destiny of a culture. The great tradition, which made genius dispensable, is replaced by great fact-men, whose accidental appearance can elevate an era into an epoch and whose death can cause the total collapse of all their enterprises. To be sure, the transition period from culture to civilization also had its phenomena of pure force--Napoleon or Alexander.</p>
<p>But there was always the strong tradition of the Baroque at its back, and the pulse of being had not yet completely died out. The culture had bound up all forces in a strict form. With the appearance of Napoleon, they were released--and in time, Feature broke forth. Cabinet diplomacy had been conducted within definite rules. The wars of the 18th century consisted of the maneuvers of small armies under well-understood conditions. However, the era preceding Caesarism replaces the absolute state with a battling society of states. This marks the dawn of the great individual, beginning in the Classical with Hannibal and in the West with the World War. Wars become ever more violent and uncompromising. Until the beginning of civilization, the technique of war had always been subsidiary to the development of craftsmanship.</p>
<p>Now, the requirements of continuous war or potential war necessitate the subservience of all mechanical means to instruments of destruction and largely condition technical progress by its assumed fitness for military operations. Universal military service and mass charges dominate battles that would have appeared madness to contemporaries of Frederick the Great. The ruthlessness of the peace conditions matches the expenditure of force.</p>
<p>Starting with Napoleon, the conventions of 18th-century warfare began to be violated. Only physical restrictions tend to limit the exploitation of military successes. The Treaty of Versailles deliberately avoided final conditions of peace, enabling the victors to modify their demands with the changing situation.</p>
<p>Imperialism is the inevitable product of civilization--an outward thrust to hide the inner void. After the formlessness of the early conflicts, the most self-assured power emerges as the dominating force. The vacuum created by the collapse of all inner meaning is so strong that it does not matter whether a people wills to assume this role. It is seized and pushed into it. Rome did not conquer its Empire, maintaining the essence of its dominance in the Mediterranean area.</p>
<p>It condensed itself into that form, and despite Scipio's awareness of the dangers, Rome could not escape its destiny. So it will be with the West.</p>
<p>The power centers will become ever fewer, the tensions ever greater, and the wars more violent. The great foci of power will decide the fate of continents until Caesarism, in its political form, supervenes, and life gradually slips back into biological periods. In the souls of the people arises, at this stage, a great desire for peace. Every civilization knows the cry for reconciliation and universal understanding. However, the logic of the age of Caesarism will not allow it. "The Hague Conference of 1907 was a prelude to the World War; the Washington Conference of 1922 will have been the precursor of others." A civilization does not permit a people to choose its mode of life, judging by its fitness for the struggle. In this task, whatever remains of old traditions--representing the organic factors, such as the U.S. Constitution--acquires tremendous force and can bring about historical results of great magnitude. Money at the beginning of this period permeates public life. Economics, the activity that belongs to the superficial side of being and its mere preserving aspects, becomes the primary mode of thought in the young Cosmopolis. Ethics becomes social engineering.</p>
<p>The conception of the thought: "What shall it profit a man if he shall gain the whole world and lose his own soul?" But money is merely a form of thought, ordering all activity concerning itself. Like all problems of Culture, it will reach a state of absolute inner finishedness, no matter how powerful its present manifestations. The dynamic economics of the Faustian Culture, symbolized by double-entry bookkeeping--a pure spatial analysis of an economic condition in which the true values are production and work, rather than gold, as mistakenly assumed--has reached the limit of its inner possibilities. Just as at the time of Diocletian, thinking in terms of money will gradually cease, and the force of law--thee has constructed its relationship to the macrocosm in such a masterful fashion or achieved such a thoroughgoing revision of its environment. The working hypothesis ever exhibits the Faustian attitude towards the universe. Work and deed are the great ethical concepts of this Culture, with Kant's categorical imperative being a command of activity. However, technical knowledge will be of no avail to a soul that has lost its meaning. If the best young minds of the future no longer see life's purpose in practical pursuits and withdraw into mysticism, and if succeeding generations become obsessed with the Satanism of their creations, then nothing can stop the decay of this prime symbol, a creation of the intellect and not of pure labor, as Marx supposed.</p>
<p>This will be the stage of pure Caesarism, a formless force that, whatever its outward trappings, will depend on the personal power of its possessor. The huge citizen-militia is replaced by the chief's followings--private armies whose destinies depend on their leaders, reminiscent of the times of Caesar, Pompey, and Octavian. The real focus of events becomes the Megalopolis, where wars of infinite bloodiness occur due to their private nature.</p>

<p>The victorious Caesarism will then constitute the last attempt by the powers of the blood, doomed to petrification because the fire in the soul of the Civilization has long died out. Its outward manifestations are mere appearances. People's rights take the place of the scepter and crown in constitutional monarchy. They are carefully paraded for the multitudes to hide their total lack of real meaning. With power devoid of tradition as its last manifestation, and with waking-consciousness defeated by itself, the Civilization turns into a fellah state where time is meaningless, and history comes to an end.</p>
<p>"And so the drama of a high culture--that wondrous world of deities, arts, thoughts, battles, cities--closes with the return of the pristine facts of the blood eternal that is one and the same as the ever-circling cosmic flow. The bright imaginative Waking-Being submerges itself into the silent service of Being, as the Chinese and Roman empires tell us. Time triumphs over Space, and it is Time whose inexorable movement embeds the ephemeral incident of the Culture on this planet in the incident of man--a form wherein the incident life flows on for a time, while behind it all the streaming horizons of geological and stellar histories pile up in the light-world of our eyes."</p>
<p>"For us, however, whom a Destiny has placed in this Culture and at this moment of its development--the moment when Caesarism is celebrating its last victories, and the Caesarism that is to succeed approaches with quiet, firm step--our direction, willed and obligatory at once, is set for us within narrow limits, and on any other terms life is not worth living. We do not have the freedom to reach for this or that, but the freedom to do the necessary or to do nothing. A task that historic necessity has set will be accomplished with the individual or against him."</p>
<h2 id="spenglers-metaphysical-dilemma">Spengler's Metaphysical Dilemma</h2>
<p>Spengler's metaphysical dilemma permeates his political theory, which contains many similarities with the Platonic conception of degeneration as the consequence of a loss of tradition and the dominance of selfishness. The Estates represent the quintessence of creativity, embodying need and training, and thereby become the focal points of world history. Yet just how is this creativity accomplished?</p>
<p>The Nobility symbolizes pure becoming, while the Priesthood typifies waking-consciousness. Since the essence of the former is comprised in living a destiny and that of the latter in confining itself to the world as eternally possible, expressed by a withdrawal from history, it is difficult to ascertain what constitutes Spengler's criterion for ascribing equal symbolic significance to their appearance as estates.</p>
<p>If the Nobility does nothing but live a destiny, it cannot be considered creative. If the Priesthood represents mere waking-consciousness, it does not possess any characteristic symbolism. Furthermore, if religion is a construction of waking-consciousness, one should expect its early manifestations to be hesitant and unsure of themselves, attaining ever greater mastery of form with the emancipation of waking-consciousness in the development of Culture.</p>
<p>In fact, the opposite is true in Spengler's scheme. The period of greatest religious creative force occurs at the beginning of the Culture and Caesarism, which sees religion, like all other manifestations, devoid of any symbolic significance.</p>
<p>The nobility, as the prime estate, appears unable, by itself, to achieve that inner purposiveness which Spengler considers the outstanding characteristic of the State. Indeed, the State comes into existence only against its opposition. If the symbolism of the State finds its expression in an idea that transcends mere becoming, it seems evident that this idea is a function of waking consciousness, not of an immanent destiny.</p>
<p>Moreover, as Spengler points out, the Magian cultures articulate themselves almost exclusively through the symbolism of a Priesthood, with the nobility playing a subsidiary role. The conclusion appears, despite many striking insights, that the strict separation of becoming and being into a postulate of alternatives has no standing in reality. Both are merely tendencies, the relative predominance of which characterizes modes of world experience.</p>
<p>Purposiveness without an organic framework is meaningless. <em>Pure existence</em> describes an animal state. All creativity requires waking consciousness, but effective leadership will take into account the unconscious factors of motivation. It must be admitted that in many respects Spengler acknowledges this. In the chapter on mathematics, he explicitly affirms the interrelationship.</p>
<p>"Luther was the creation, not of intellectual necessity but of destiny." It would be better to say that destiny embodies itself in intellectual necessity. Political conduct reveals not just an inexorable immanence but a process of becoming consciously evaluated. Luther was consequently more than the creation of historical necessity; he was the shaper of a tendency, the inspiration of a dimly felt longing.</p>
<p>Life reveals not merely activity, but <em>purposeful activity</em>. Politics is not a simple problem of living the organic immanence but of recognizing the possibilities of the situation. As the acme of culture gradually decreases, Culture transforms into Civilization amidst a series of cataclysmic wars. Finally, with</p>
<h1 id="waking-consciousness-defeated-by-itself-the-powers-of-the-blood">Waking Consciousness Defeated by Itself, the Powers of the Blood</h1>
<p>asserting themselves, life reverts to the fellah state of creation and impotence; Civilization petrifies and dies. Despite the poetic imaginativeness of this philosophy and its many startlingly accurate predictions, our analysis has revealed serious difficulties. The opposition between waking consciousness and becoming, between Time and Space, History and Causality expresses but does not resolve the dilemma of the experience of freedom in a determined environment. Spengler believes that history reveals an inexorable destiny, with its triumphs being a consequence of an almost unconscious participation in the process of becoming. However, much of his data disproves these contentions. If each culture constructs its own image of the world and spends its existence in an attempt to actualize it, then the dialogical sequence of generations attains symbolism only through an inward experience. Since experiences are unique and necessity can govern only the general, the specificity of each culture is a function of freedom, not a blindly working organic immanence. Destiny requires waking consciousness to actualize its possibilities.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if the life of each culture represents an effort to actualize its prime symbol, one would expect the historical development of the culture to vary as much as their symbolism. Spengler, however, has postulated an identical political institutionalization at comparable stages of existence. This leads to the conclusion that cultures may not represent as self-contained organisms as Spengler suggests. The very possibility of analyzing another culture's soul indicates a degree of inner relationship, compounded by the fact that Spengler seriously examines only the Faustian, Apollonian, and Magian cultures. Spengler's denial of the interrelationship of cultures and their inability to ever understand each other's symbols is thus refuted by his approach. If the symbols of another culture must always remain inwardly remote, it is difficult to see what governs the continuation of any ideology. However, if most cultures begin by adopting foreign symbols, then it can hardly be asserted that these forms did not condition their users. Though Christianity may have been adapted to fit the needs of the Christian soul, the whole history of the West was permeated by the particular spirituality of this well-organized institution, with its heritage of the Greco-Roman tradition. The infusion of new meaning into cold forms involves a different process than spontaneous creativity.</p>
<h2 id="meaning-of-events">Meaning of Events</h2>
<p>The meaning of events can be understood only as a unity, a destiny purposively evaluated, as history consciously lived. Purely analytical criticism of Spengler will, however, never discover the profounder levels of his philosophy. These reside in his evocation of those elements of life that will ever be the subject of an inner experience, in his intuition of a relational relationship to the infinite that expresses personality. Spengler's vision encompassed an approach to history which--whatever our opinion of his conclusions--transcended the mere causal analysis of data and the shallow dogmatism of many progress theories. No discussion of internal structure can invalidate the force of Spengler's description of Christ's journey to Jerusalem or the dramatic quality of the exposition of the dilemma in Michelangelo's soul. After all has been said, the conviction remains that Spengler had found a poetry in life that rises above the barren systematization of its manifestations. To be sure, such an approach presents dangers. The latent anti-intellectualism may well lead to a cult of sheer emotion.</p>
<h2 id="philosophical-distinctions">Philosophical Distinctions</h2>
<p>In any philosophical discussion, one must sharply distinguish the philosophical assumptions from their argument. A refutation of the latter may merely mean that the metaphysical postulates are capable of stronger supporting formulation. Logic can aid in evaluating internal consistency and relevance but is no test for the metaphysical assumptions, which can be analyzed only by utilizing another set of assumptions, not an objective standard of validity. It is possible, therefore, to offer different explanations for all of Spengler's symbols of soul-images without refuting the concept of the inner life of a culture (See Appendix A - The Concepts of Meaning).</p>
<h2 id="validity-of-arguments">Validity of Arguments</h2>
<p>The fact that certain arguments, if pressed to an extremity, involve unacceptable consequences does not necessarily disprove their validity. It indicates rather that in the ultimate problems of life, man must find the sanction for his conduct within himself, not in technical solutions. Every event is not merely an effect but also an experience. As an effect, it is subject to causal determination; as an experience, it contains the meaning of freedom and the essence of personality. This accounts for the unsatisfactoriness of ethical systems such as Northrop's, which conceives values as approachable by mere methodology. It was not, after all, Spinoza's geometrical method that led to his ethical concepts but his inner attitude that a priori directed the method.</p>
<h2 id="critique-of-spengler">Critique of Spengler</h2>
<p>It was Spengler's merit that he understood the underlying unity of all manifestations of human endeavor, though his poetic imagination caused him to overvalue the realms of necessity and underestimate the purposive element. Perhaps the most serious criticism to be made against Spengler consists of what Dante has illustrated: the interdependence of reason and inner experience, causality and grace. On the climb to the top of Mount Purgatory, he has absorbed the essence of human wisdom. Henceforth, only an inner experience can conduct him. When Beatrice answers, he turns for guidance to Virgil, but reason is here powerless. Just as Plato's Idea of the Good and Kant's experience of freedom, the final attainment of human transcendence is a matter of inner illumination, not technical manipulation. See post for full development of this idea in Chapter "The Sense of Responsibility."</p>

<p>In establishing patterns of phenomenal knowledge, all manifestations of human activity are included, even those specifically excepted by Kant: our knowledge of God, freedom, immortality, and morality. If Kant conditioned all subsequent metaphysics, it is certain that Hegel is immanent in most of the philosophy of history, no matter how passionate the denial.</p>
<p>His concept of history as the manifestation of the idea in time and Nature as the representation of the spirit in space was adopted by Spengler with only minor modifications. The destiny that is our experience of history differs neither in its inward necessity nor in its self-realization of the Spirit. For Hegel's rationality was not, after all, Kant's pure reason, but had as its ultimate criterion actuality. Darwin, too, be he ever so derided, is implicit in much of Spengler. The theory of evolution may well be no more than a working hypothesis, particularly adapted to the mentality of twentieth-century England and logically replaceable by a catastrophe.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, its primary test of physical survival is reiterated by Spengler as the criterion of fitness in his World-as-History. Spengler's striking counterpart is Vico's philosophy of history, which, however, is never mentioned in "The Decline of the West." Vico, too, saw in history a cyclical recurrence of civilizations, their growth exhibiting discrete phases of activity. The occult wisdom of the early stage is based on a religious experience, but as the mystery of life disappears, reason becomes dominant. The philosophical wisdom of the Culture's maturity expresses the claims of a rationality fully conscious of its power.</p>
<p>No stage of development can be maintained, however. The necessary realization of a Culture's immanence follows an inevitable pattern. Vico is thus the modern precursor of a systematic cyclical theory.</p>
<h1 id="scholarly-criticism-of-spengler">Scholarly Criticism of Spengler</h1>
<p>Scholarly criticism of Spengler has been sporadic and frequently beside the point. Sabine's brief summary is a tirade and not an analysis. V. S. Yarros confines himself to characterizing Spengler as the apostle of the new pessimism, citing in opposition the "progress" achieved in social legislation and political liberty by Western man. The article suffers from having been written on the eve of the most demoniacal outburst of the "progressive" West.</p>
<p>The most profound analysis is probably that of Eduard Meyer, who, though accepting many of Spengler's conclusions, opposes to the concept of the organic culture of definite extent and fixed duration the idea of overlapping culture-circles. These circles have a manifold capability of absorbing alien influences and different developments, and their decline is a result, not a cause, of excessive involvement in imperialistic ventures.</p>
<p>Thus, a purposive element of choice is imported into Spengler's development, with fatedness being the result, at least in part, of human volition. Is Spengler a determinist? This question is not as absurd as it might appear from a cursory reading of his philosophy.</p>
<h1 id="determinism">Determinism</h1>
<p>Spengler took this into account, though his enthusiasm leads to a formulation that seems to negate his theoretical awareness. Incident and destiny are the differentia that represent the opposition; the historical direction, which is fixed and unalterable, inherently capable as death--constitutes Destiny. Its embodiment in actuality, however, depends on incidents.</p>
<p>It was an incident that Columbus discovered America as the agent of the Spanish rather than the French throne, thereby setting the style of politics of the next centuries by Madrid instead of Paris. But it was a destiny that the late period of the West should accomplish itself through absolutism to a Revolution. That this revolution occurred in France was an incident, but it was a destiny that Napoleonism should accompany the turn of the culture into a civilization.</p>
<p>There are personal incidents when a great man such as Napoleon concentrates the whole meaning of an epoch in himself and thereby accomplishes in a few years what under the impersonal incident of an epoch it took the Classical era to achieve. The inner logic of events is fixed, the general tendencies of development are determined, but its incidental appearance is the result of the self-assurance and the work of people who can live a destiny rather than suffer it.</p>
<p>This leads to the dilemma inherent in all philosophy of history that stresses the organic aspect as a postulate of actions, namely, the connection between the necessary and the possible.</p>
<h2 id="kants-dilemma">Kant's Dilemma</h2>
<p>It is a problem which Kant too considered and failed to solve completely. In order to establish the validity of his categorical imperative as a foundation of eternal peace, Kant was forced to demonstrate the possibility of its application. However, his proof of feasibility became a dictum of necessity and seems to negate the moral basis of the categorical imperative.</p>
<p>Similarly, Spengler concluded by posing the alternatives of doing the necessary or doing nothing. Yet this is a description of a psychological state rather than a guide for action. Just as the pleasure principle in psychology describes a definitional motivation to past action but is totally useless as a standard for the prediction of future action, this refutes the argument that Spengler's later work "The House of Decision" represents a logical inconsistency.</p>
<p>He merely describes in that book the possible lines of action open to Western culture in its present stage of development. Even a man may desire to do the necessary or pleasurable, varying the fields of activity; and though the emphasis may be on either the moral or material aspect of life, not the postulate of necessity but the content ascribed to it constitutes the real criterion for motivated activity.</p>
<p>Spengler's only standard for a necessary action is its success. Apart from the fact that this represents no aid whatever in the really crucial personal# Protestant Christianity May Disappear</p>
<p>The difficulty of the pleasure principle derives from the hedonistic implications of the word in everyday language. For what is really meant by the pleasure principle?</p>
<p>The psychologist counters arguments that most persons are incapable of striking a rational balance between various possible sources of satisfaction with an assertion of the unconscious factor of motivation. Since it is a fact that many persons commit acts that are actually painful, the psychologist finds refuge in a balance of greater and lesser pain. What he is really saying is that every action must have a preponderance of motives for its performance, and he is thus describing motivated activity--if not merely activity--not pleasure. Of course, a scientist has a perfect right to adopt any definition suitable (see Appendix A), provided that he stays within the conventional meaning of his terms. Moreover, the equation of pleasure and motive is really no help at all, for it merely shifts the main problem from a definition of motive to a definition of pleasure. It is never clear whether actions result from pleasure or whether pleasure is that form from which actions result, and in the final analysis, these conceptions must be used. The same argument holds for the "necessity concept."</p>
<h1 id="from-the-faces-of-the-earth">From the Faces of the Earth</h1>
<p>Will that reduce Luther to a meaningless incident? Moreover, since history is itself a function of the soul-image of a culture and its awareness is a result of its symbolism, it appears that Destiny and Incident, necessary and accidental, are merely transitory manifestations of a particular depth experience and not applicable as a guide to activity.</p>
<p>Two misconceptions seem to be involved in the problem of necessity as a sanction of conduct: a confusion of the doer and the action, and of the intent with the tendency. For activity can, in retrospect, be proved to have resulted from free will, the fact of action indicating a preponderance of factors on one side. In this view, all actions are determined. On the other hand, only deeds embodying the logic of history are necessary.</p>
<p>How can one reconcile this dilemma? The intent and the tendency of historical figures are radically different, as Spengler frequently points out. Of what use is a tenet as a rule to do the necessary? Wherein lies the mystery of results that are totally incommensurable with intention and yet dependent for their appearance on such willed activity? The greater the interval between the event and the analysis, the more determined the act appears, as Tolstoy already emphasized. With the passage of time, all the manifold possibilities that accompanied performance are forgotten, and only the question remains, a testimony to its irrevocability.</p>
<p>Man, despite time, can never imagine anything totally out of his frame of reference and the detailed historical development that might have ensued. If, for example, Richelieu had not interfered in the Thirty Years' War, it is beyond the scope of even the most prudent historian to ascertain what might have happened. Undoubtedly, the frustrated soul of a suddenly transitioned Germany in the 1920s cried out for something to hold on to. But none of Hitler's lieutenants, as abundant evidence shows, could have unleashed the demoniacal forces that were eventually produced by the Führer. Yet Hitler's fate hung by a thread many times. Some little incident always saved him; always, in the minds of the chief actors, there existed meaningful alternatives.</p>
<p>Whatever our view of the necessity of these events today, the key question is how far necessity could have served either as a guide to action or for the prediction of outcomes.</p>
<h1 id="events-in-1933">Events in 1933</h1>
<p>Similarly, Spengler's analysis of British political development contains many challenging observations about the state that triumphed in the 17th century. This demonstrates the essential characteristic of historical necessity. No matter what we may think of its compelling quality, it always appears to man in the guise of freedom. There always seem to exist alternatives between which one can choose, and without such alternatives, life would be unthinkable. This is perhaps the profoundest meaning of the union of the categorical imperative with historical necessity in Kant. Necessity, as a guide to action, is useless, even for a pragmatist. The number of historical figures who died believing themselves to have failed, yet represented the future of their culture, is legion, as is the number of those whose pinnacle of temporary success merely served to hide the historical hollowness of their position.</p>
<p>The question of conceptual historical necessity can be safely left unsettled, for it is prejudged by our experience of freedom. Freedom is not a definitional quantity but an inner experience of life as a process of deciding meaningful alternatives. This does not mean unlimited choice. Everybody is a product of an age, a nation, and an environment. But, beyond that, he constitutes what is essentially unapproachable by analysis, the form of the form, the creative essence of history, the moral personality. However we may explain actions in retrospect, their accomplishment occurred with the inner conviction of choice.</p>
<p>This is not to say that Spengler's view of the development of culture through youth, maturity, decline, and death is without merit. To life belongs death in history, as this cannot serve as the ultimate reconciliation of this inconsistency in Kant. See post Ch IV "History and Man's Experience of Morality."</p>
<h2 id="individuals-and-culture">Individuals and Culture</h2>
<p>In individuals, no culture has yet been permanent, and no striving completely fulfilled. It is not given to man to choose his age, or to the statesman the condition of his time. But the form taken by the particular period, the meaning given to life, is the task of each generation. Man can find the sanction for his actions only within himself, not in the discovery of purposes in phenomena. It is a responsibility correctly seen as a duty since even inactivity postulates an absolute norm.</p>
<p>And so we come to the final problem in Spengler: that of youth and age. Can one ascribe organic periods to cultures? In how far is the analogy to organic experience valid? It seems certain that to man, the problem of age is closely tied to a physiological state. After a certain period of life, the knowledge of a limit becomes ever more definite, and the inexorability of development in light of one's past is inevitable. The knowledge of the transitory nature of existence is responsible for much consistency in action and gives rise to the tragedy of the man who must live out an essentially meaningless belief.</p>
<p>Yet age is not exclusively a physiological state. Life exhibits an eternal recurrence of problems, the settlement of which shapes the cultural experience.</p>
<p>Each Conditioning and Weakening the Ability to Respond to Others</p>
<p>It is a dilemma in which abstract argument cannot go much further. The physiological analogy is not tenable with cultures, yet the existence of civilizations may be conceived as a succession of dilemmas. Toynbee correctly analyzed the challenge and response element but turned it into a mechanistic method for material salvation. It appears that the solution of each problem takes away something of the ability to experience its inner meaning, gradually lessening the intensity of the response.</p>
<p>The League of Nations was a dream; the United Nations is merely a technical clearinghouse, perhaps therefore of no duration as its inner idea is dissipated. Aging in a culture may well be the gradual solution of the problems immanent in its existence, their content leading to a deep pessimism. Immortality cannot be achieved by postulate. However, behind the physical decay that seems to affect everything existing emerges a level of meaning that embodies a type of attainable permanence. In its death, each culture bequeaths forms to the successor which, contrary to Spengler's assertion, are the condition precedent to all subsequent problematization and the foundation of future greatness.</p>
<p>Mommsen has stated it well:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"We are faced with the end of the Roman Republic. For half a millennium, we observed her ruling the countries of the Mediterranean. We have seen her collapse in politics, in morals, in religion, and in literature, not through the violence of external events, but through a gradual inward decay. The world which Caesar found contained much of the noble heritage of past centuries and an infinite world; not to be made young again even by the genius of Caesar's sundance of pomp and glory, but little spirit, still less taste. Above all, the joy had gone out of life. &gt;<br />
It was indeed an old patriotism. The serenity of the dawn cannot return until darkness has set in and night has reigned supreme. But nevertheless, it brought to the sorely harassed peoples on the Mediterranean a tolerable evening after the sultry noon. And when in good time, after a long historical night, the day of new peoples dawned again and young nations in free self-fulfillment began to move towards new and higher goals, there were among them quite a few in which the seed strewn by Caesar had borne fruit and which owed him, as they still do, the distinctive character of their nationality."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Perhaps this is the only immortality a culture has a right to require. Thus, Spengler's philosophy of history, with its challenging intuitions and broad vistas, represents an attempt at the resolution of the enigmas of existence. He clearly realized the necessity of an explicit metaphysical foundation for the comprehension of History-as-an-Intuition.</p>

<p>Minority, sensing the rift in society, turns itself into a dominant minority and rules by force. The uncreative majority and the barbarians beyond the borders secede, forming the internal and external proletariat. The rift in the body social parallels a schism in the soul, from the tensions of which the universal state appears the immediate solution. However, an unsuccessful series of responses has doomed the civilization. Its inner meaning is salvaged by the higher religion that the internal proletariat creates on the ruins of the collapsing universal state. After a violent interregnum, the universal church becomes the chrysalis from which a new society may spring by the process of apparition and affiliation.</p>
<p>The approach of the study, which bases itself on "the well-beloved method of making an empirical survey," leads Toynbee into inner contradictions. An empiricist will always be faced with the validation of those normative concepts, for which history offers no necessary proof, and phenomena no universal rule. The formulation of historical laws implies a conception of necessity, not to be evaded by a mere postulation of purposiveness. Against a background of twenty-one civilizations that either have collapsed or exhibit all the symptoms of decay, challenges and responses, with their accompanying doctrines of withdrawal and return, become not a negation of inevitability but its mechanistic description. Moreover, an empirical survey has a tendency to consider mere surface phenomena as equivalent, since the inner interpretative meaning must constitute a metaphysical resolution.</p>
<p>Toynbee compounds this by imposing a normative pattern on a comparative study of civilizations, all of which are conceived as philosophically contemporary and functionally equivalent. A Platonic identification of political action with appropriate types of souls results in an affirmation of a supramundane plane of history that embodies the true fulfillment of existence.</p>
<p>It will be our task to analyze the validity of attempts at finding solutions to problems of inner experience in the causal manifestations of life. We must determine the degree of reality that can be ascribed to analogies from mythology or the New Testament. This will bring us face to face with our basic enigma: Does history or life exhibit a master plan, the understanding of which offers a key to the dilemmas in our souls, or does the solution reside in an inner reconciliation? Must we look outside or inside ourselves for a motive force to comprehend the essence of history as a guide to action? Can a metaphysical pattern be utilized in a study that professes to find its proof in the first instance in empirical data?</p>
<p>Every philosophy of history must sooner or later face the problem of what constitutes the motive force of directed life.</p>
<p>Spengler opted for an organic immanence that ruled all happenings. Toynbee could not face the dilemma in this context. He argued that life presented a series of challenges, the response to which revealed a personality and whose solution was therefore unpredictable. Yet this assertion of freedom clashed with his empirical data that indicated almost certain decay for each civilization.</p>
<p>Toynbee tried to solve this difficulty by considering history as the realization of a divine plan, in which "the seeds sown are separate seeds, each with its own destiny, but all of one kind, and sown by the same Sower in the hope of attaining one harvest." Growth and decay merely hide an underlying unity through which God reveals Himself to mankind. Life presents an alternation of activity and decay, of integration and differentiation. While events seem superficially recurrent, history actually operates in the fashion of a wheel, the circular motion of which serves as the condition for progress.</p>
<p>Toynbee's metaphysical doctrine is nowhere explicitly stated. To give it the most complete presentation, I have utilized Dante's philosophy, which seems closest to the implied concept of Toynbee's, and applied it to the concept of Transfiguration, which is the key to Toynbee's cosmology.</p>
<p>The disintegration of civilizations merely exhibits the condition for a higher experience, for the vision of the supra-mundane reality which is of and beyond this world, the City of GodToynbee answers the problem with two analogies: one geometrical, concerning the nature of the relation of a square to the side of a plane of a cube, and the other geographical, based on a temporal superimposition of successive layers of settlements on the same site. Neither analogy is completely satisfactory. The geometrical simile merely proves the feasibility of constructing such a relation, not its existence. The geographical analogy illustrates the truism that every physical object is part of a larger whole.</p>
<p>Man participates in a divine plan and, insofar as he is God's creature, is incapable of attaining greater perfection. The cognition of the first intelligence (the self-evidence of certain axioms) and the affection for the first objects of desire (the pure love of God) express the divine imprint. However, man is also fallen from Eden. He has tasted the fruit of good and evil, a sin both because of its timing and the overstepping of limits. Man's fall has been so deep, and the corruption of his nature so extensive that, unaided, he would be totally incapable of transcending his fallen state. Humanity attains the possibility of Grace only through the majesty of Christ's sacrifice. Its existence reveals an unceasing struggle for the self-realization of a will corrupted by desire. Reason, "the virtue that counsels," constitutes the agency by which the will is directed toward its proper end. The potentiality to love God expresses man's true essence; the misdirection of this feeling encompasses the fatedness of existence. Inward blessedness reflects God's love and that of all true believers and serves as the condition for immortality. Yet this love cannot achieve the full implications of its immanence in the mundane sphere or by merely rational conditions. Only Paradise sees the complete union of Will, Desire, and Reason. There, everything coalesces in the all-embracing Love of God. This is the true meaning of Piccarda Donati.</p>
<p>It must be reiterated that this represents my construction of the spirit of Toynbee's metaphysics.</p>

<p>The symbolic appearance in the Moon expresses both Volition and Necessity. To Dante, the rational query regarding the justices of degrees of bliss appears essentially meaningless. That, too, is the import of the ability, peculiar to the blessed, to read each other's thoughts. In Paradise, indeed, the "virtue that counsels" has become superfluous, at least in its directing connotations. Knowledge is now instantaneous, and belief is no longer subject to either buttressing or argument. Everything merges in a total unity brought about by the radiance of an all-illuminating Grace.</p>
<p>This exhibits the assumptions of Toynbee's metaphysical doctrine, which suffers from an overly utilitarian argumentation and a lack of explicit formulation. God's love, identical with that of man's love for Him, expressed in the feeling of brotherhood, constitutes the condition for the experience of transfiguration, the connecting link between mundane and supra-mundane reality. The conception of transcendence is symbolically expressed by Christianity in God, the Father, and the aspect of immanence in God, the Holy Ghost. Christ, the Son of God, who sacrificed Himself to attain blessedness for His own, represents the connecting link to the human heart, however great the logical difficulty reason finds in the Trinity.</p>

</ol>
<p>His metaphysics enable Toynbee to impose a normative pattern on historical events. He validates the attitudes toward life that characterize a disintegrating civilization.</p>
<p>In terms of Christian thought, the philosophy of Detachment violates the imperative of the brotherhood of Man based on God's Love. Therefore, Socrates' death loses meaning, since it represented a futile reaction to the schism in the Hellenic soul and attempted to transfer its field of action forward on a merely mundane plane. This also explains the moral sanction implicit in such statements as the "criminality of militarism" and the "greater treasure rejected by the Jews," whose inability to accept Christ doomed their civilization.</p>
<p>Toynbee's metaphysical assumptions permeate his concept.</p>
<h1 id="primitive-humanity">Primitive Humanity</h1>
<p>Primitive humanity represents a <em>Yin</em> state of Integration, the condition precedent to a further advance in the divine scheme of things. The creative minority contains the Saints, in whose souls a spark of the divine has kindled a response and who constitute the "virtue that counsels," doomed by mechanicalness.</p>
<h2 id="atanda-the-city-of-destruction">Atanda the City of Destruction</h2>
<p>Atanda, the City of Destruction, serves as a testimony to man's present inadequacy but also as a token, through its creation, of a universal church of potential fulfillment. It encompasses layers of meaning beyond those of Spengler and is rooted in the tradition of the British Empiricists. He asserted that history revealed its immanence through the application of the proper methodology and the patient classification of data. However, such an approach is inconsistent with Toynbee's philosophical basis. A mere empirical analysis of history is impossible, as the regularity observed in phenomena constitutes a metaphysical assumption of order. An empiricist is unable to find purposiveness in history, since all regularity implies at least the necessity of constant confusion. A historical "law" always denies the unique experience or the creative act, reducing both to aspects of an inexorability that continuously produces new surface manifestations of success and power. Success constitutes the final lesson that historical phenomena teach man. Each accomplished fact and each surviving political organization testifies to a method of prevailing, representing an answer to the pragmatic query: "What works?" A mere collection of historical data can never be constructed free from the metaphysical postulation inherent in it.</p>
<h2 id="toynbees-methodology">Toynbee's Methodology</h2>
<p>Toynbee, however, did not merely attempt to probe deeper. Selectivity will always represent a negation of freedom and an assertion of determinism. The alternatives that accompanied the willed performance are forgotten, and only the deed remains a testimony to its fatedness. Failure constitutes the only sin known to history in an empirical and pragmatic approach. Toynbee does not succeed in constructing an edifice based on empirical considerations. His conclusions align with his philosophical assumptions and theological convictions. A pragmatist should have been careful about a method that yields an answer so obviously in line with his preconceptions.</p>
<p>Nobody better illustrates the memesis of the "ego-centric delusion" than Toynbee, who castigates it violently. Love is not immanent in historical data but constitutes a resolve of the soul. History is not a book designed to illustrate the New Testament, nor do Christ's sayings embody truisms for "successful" conduct. The superimposition of the inner meaning, the noumena of existence, and the consequences of our experience of freedom.</p>
<p>It is impossible to find a guarantee for the realization of religious faith in the appearance of historical phenomena. Such a guarantee would reduce ethics to rules of prudence. A violator of the moral code would, in this view, be not a knave, but a fool. Freedom is not achieved by the mere assertion of purposiveness that itself becomes but a manifestation of historical law, classifiable as a mechanistic technique for blessedness. The salvation of souls and the growth and decay of civilizations are not connected by a causality denoted by immediate reward and punishment. The wheel of existence may utilize its circular motion to progress along virgin ground. Yet no civilization has yet succeeded in this endeavor, and decay has marked their advance, even in Toynbee's terms.</p>
<p>The conception of virgin ground constitutes the longing of a soul, the hope of a fulfillment, for the attainment of which we must look into ourselves and not attempt to coax it out of history by conjuring its phenomena. # Ed Relation in Time</p>
<p>The Ed relation in time constitutes an aspect of the deepening of the religious vocation but does not result in successive stages that plot a uniform advance. These stages are philosophically equivalent, functionally contemporary, and allow for a comparison to determine the laws governing historical processes.</p>
<p>If civilizations represent genes of a new species, this statement from Toynbee (op. cit. Vol. I, p. 175) contradicts the whole tendency of Vol. V and Vol. VI. This argument implies that Toynbee is aware of the goal and presents another inconsistency in his empirical scheme. Toynbee (op. cit. I, p. 176) also discusses this inconsistency.</p>
<p>What accounts for the imitation of social assets which the acquirers have not originated for themselves and which they might never have come to possess if they had not encountered and imitated other people in whose possession these assets were found?</p>
<p><em>Mimesis</em> is a social drill, with its direction towards the past characteristic of primitive societies, and its utilization for new creativity marking civilizations. This raises the question of whether the difference between civilizations and primitive societies is permanent and fundamental; Toynbee's metaphysical assumption of cyclical progress determines the answer. Since all existence exhibits a process of growth and a mode of evolutionary survival, civilizations can represent merely the most recent stage of historical development.</p>
<p>The transformation of Sub-Man into Man, which must have occurred in a social environment, is postulated by Toynbee as having been accomplished under the aegis of primitive societies. This transformation testifies to a level of dynamic creativeness surpassing any achievement of the more recent species of civilizations. The present static condition of primitive societies is therefore deceptive; it does not exhibit uninspired torpor but rather the last stage of integration.</p>
<p>Mankind's task is likened by Toynbee to climbing a vast mountain surrounded by ledges. The exertion required for climbing its steep sides results in a feverish activity that sometimes produces strength sufficient for reaching the next ledge, but more often results in a loss of grip and a drop to death on a lower level. The limitations of human vision confine it to scanning only one perpendicular and one horizontal surface. The exhausted figures on the ledge are therefore frequently mistaken for paralytics, while the climbers are perceived as embodiments of activity. However, reflection reveals that the figures on the ledge could have attained it only through prodigious efforts, and that many ledges below must be strewn with the corpses of failures from a previous dynamism.</p>
<p>Thus, the difference between primitive societies and civilizations is neither fundamental nor permanent, but rather an accident of time and place of observation. The present static condition of primitive societies merely calls to mind past motion, just as the activity of civilizations will cease when Man has.</p>
<h1 id="toynbees-biological-approach">Toynbee's Biological Approach</h1>
<p>Toynbee's biological approach overrides any mere postulation of purposiveness. History is an evolutionary process encompassing alternate stages of integration and differentiation. The genesis of civilizations testifies to a mutation from the static condition to creative effort. This holds true even in cases of apparentation and affiliation. With respect to the internal proletariat, the dominant minorities are static by definition. The secession of the internal proletariat reveals the dynamic reaction that changes torpor into activity and integration into new differentiation. The births of civilizations form particular beats of a general rhythmic pulse of the universe. This explains the nature of the genesis of civilizations but not their particular appearance at a definite time. What are the factors that lift these entities out of the stream of humanity? What accounts for the long interval of Yin before the climb up the precipice commences? True to his empirical method, Toynbee examines all possible causes before drawing conclusions. He finds the negative factor that retards activity in a vis inertia, the "cake of custom," and the inherent tendency towards stability.</p>
<p>Note the similarity of this concept with Spengler and its inconsistency with the assumptions of pure volition. This serves as the foil for the creative act, the condition to be overcome before differentiation can set in. Two obvious alternatives present themselves as the positive factors. The mutation can be postulated as the consequence of some special quality of the human beings who have succeeded in making the transition. The change may, on the other hand, be attributed to a specially favorable constellation of environmental conditions. Neither hypothesis is tenable according to Toynbee. Race is a construction of human prejudice, another facet of the ego-centric delusion, for which no scientific criteria can be found. Its general acceptance in the West derives from the Protestant concept of predestination, which considers material success an indication of divine sanction and ascribes an insuperable deficiency to all disbelievers. It is reinforced by the racial theories developed from de Gobineau, whose primary concern had not been the validation of natural phenomena but political polemic. Against the self-evidence of the first assumption can be set the fact that race feeling represents a relatively recent Western phenomenon. In the medieval period, the potential equality of all humanity constituted a cornerstone of popular belief. Moreover, no connection can be established between skin color and the creative tendency that issues into the Yang state.</p>
<p>An empirical survey indicates that all races except the Negro race have at one time or another produced a civilization. The simile of the climbers on the precipice proves, however, that this deficiency need not be inherent but may result from the comparative youth of the species. The environmental theory fares no better. Its only conclusive proof, according to Toynbee, would involve an examination of all conditions that are claimed to be conducive to the genesis of civilizations and a determination of whether they were so operative wherever they occurred. Such an empirical survey will reveal a wide variety in the geographical or climatic conditions that attended the genesis of civilizations. Not every river of similar extent, such as the Colorado River, has produced a civilization.</p>

<p>In this act of creation, no demon can participate. On the mundane plane, the human protagonist constitutes the theater for this activity, and his ordeal accomplishes itself in three stages.</p>
<p>The First Stage</p>
<p>The first stage finds symbolic expression in the assault of the tempter and changes the state of Yin to Yang, from harmony to discord, from rest to motion.</p>
<p>The Second Stage</p>
<p>With awareness of the fatedness of a course from which there is no return, the second stage, the crisis, begins. The momentary rebellion at finding oneself but a tool in God's hands is transcended by the grace of reconciliation. This enables man to achieve victory through defeat, peace through suffering. Man resigns himself into God's hands and thus reverses the rhythm again--from motion towards rest, from storm to calm, from Yang back to Yin.</p>
<p>God stands revealed not as a hard taskmaster, nor as the cause of suffering, but as the all-embracing Love that made the new level of integration possible.</p>
<h2 id="toynbees-positive-factor">Toynbee's Positive Factor</h2>
<p>Toynbee's positive factor explains the sequence of civilizations and the emerging differentiation as the pattern of Challenge-and-Response. Life presents a series of challenges to undergo an ordeal. No calculation, however prudent, can serve for the prediction of historical events, for nobody can know the unknown God or the reaction of the protagonist when the ordeal actually occurs.</p>
<p>Despite this analysis of the imponderability of the response, Toynbee engages in an extensive analysis of the historically effective stimuli to determine the range of possible responses. An examination of the genesis of civilizations leads to the "law" that their birth results not from unusually easy, but from difficult environments frequently in response to changes in climate (e.g., the genesis of the Egyptian or Sumerian civilization).</p>
<p>Though at first blush the related civilizations do not seem to constitute a reaction to an environment, closer reflection indicates that their response is not to the physical but to the human environment. The internal proletariat's will to secede testifies to the dominant minority's will to repress, and the final breaking away reflects the intolerability of the challenge. Moreover, the geographical location of the affiliated civilization usually presents a greater stimulus than the physical locus of the parent civilizations. # Third Specimen of the Genus</p>
<p>The concept of equilibrium suggests that growth reveals a series of successful responses to recurring challenges. The loss of the capacity for successful response, manifested through the appearance of an excessive challenge, marks the stage of breakdown. The difficulty of uniting the metaphysical assumptions with the empirical method reappears. Toynbee's criterion for growth is externalization, which refers to the transfer of the field of action from the macrocosm to the microcosm. Toynbee the theologian equates this to an inward state. However, Toynbee the empiricist can find it only in a physical extent that ultimately becomes its own environment. Similarly, Toynbee vacillates between considering breakdown as the consequence of a deficient response or as the result of an insuperable challenge. The incommensurability of the realms of theology and biology appears in every aspect of Toynbee's analysis. Once the genesis of civilizations has been accomplished and the dangers inherent in birth have been overcome, must their subsequent development follow a uniform pattern? Does every civilization that avoids being abortive exhibit identical symptoms of growth? Toynbee denies the necessity of uninterrupted growth and distinguishes between various forms of development.</p>
<h2 id="polynesians">Polynesians</h2>
<p>The case of the Polynesians illustrates this concept of arrested civilizations. All such civilizations have been petrified in response to a challenge of such severity that its solution required a tour de force. The entire strength of the society was required to respond to this oppressive stimulus, a task achieved only at the price of establishing the civilization at a level of inflexible readiness for emergence.</p>
<p>Such was the case of the Polynesians, who responded to the challenge of the Pacific Ocean with an intensity just sufficient for the attainment of equilibrium. They succeeded in crossing the vast spaces but never with any margin of safety, until the tension went slack and their civilization degenerated into the forgotten islands of the Pacific. This scenario also reflects Toynbee's conception of the history of the Nomads, whose existence results from a successful response to the recurrent challenge of desiccation.</p>
<p>The drought forces the cultivators of the soil to either withdraw to more fertile regions or to launch themselves onto the inhospitable steppe, transforming from domesticators of plants to domesticators of animals. Manifestly, the latter is a higher art, more comparable to industrialization than to agriculture. It substitutes the indirect utilization of vegetation for the planting of crops. By means of grazing animals, the sparse produce of the steppe is transformed into food and clothing. This process involves a division of labor and a hierarchy of specialization, articulated into the nomad, animal auxiliaries (the dog, camel, etc.), and the herds.</p>
<p>The survival of the group depends on a finely tempered adaptation to an environment that leaves no margin for lax discipline and severely limits the range of possible responses. This expansion of the Nomads into settled areas results from an increase in the severity of the environment, destroying the narrow balance of survival. Alternatively, the nomad may be drawn out of the steppe by a vacuum in the neighboring society.</p>
<h2 id="transformation-of-nomadic-communities">Transformation of Nomadic Communities</h2>
<p>The transformation of a nomadic community from a master of the physical environment on the steppe to a lord of the human environment of a civilization constitutes the superlative challenge of this stage of development. The Nomad attempts to respond to this stimulus by treating his human subjects as he would his cattle, transitioning from a herder of cattle into a herder of men. This was the reaction of the Avars, who collected their Slav prisoners into flocks and placed them in a vast semicircle around the Hungarian plain.</p>
<p>While the composite society constituted by the Nomads and their flock represents the most efficient mode of survival on the steppe, their division of labor is essential for everyone's survival. The Nomad acts as an incubus in an environment of fields and cities. The organization of society into Nomads and Indigenous human cattle is economically unsound and parasitic.</p>
<p>From shepherds keeping their flocks, the Nomads turn into drones exploiting their working bees. This accounts for the impermanence of Nomad empires established on a base of sedentary people. The virtues that led to the Nomad's early successes--self-reliance and physical toughness--atrophy in an environment that no longer provides the necessary stimulus. The degeneration of the conquerors is paralleled by an increase in the stature of the sedentary settlers, for whom the existence of foreign domination constitutes a constant challenge.</p>
<h1 id="nomad-empires">Nomad Empires</h1>
<p>The history of Nomad empires is characterized by beginnings that are violent, sudden, and total. Some conquerors, such as the Osmanlis, succeeded in imposing a lasting empire on a sedentary population, but this often came at the cost of stifling their own civilization.</p>
<p>Catapulted out of the steppe into the Balkans by the pressure of the Mongols, the Osmanli political beginning was auspicious, providing a universal state that the Balkan offshoot of Orthodox Christianity had been unable to achieve for itself. The duration of the Ottoman Empire was, however, the result of a successful response to extraordinary challenges posed by the human environment.</p>
<p>The Osmanlis recognized that successful utilization of animal flocks depended not only on the relationship between the shepherd and the herd but also on the employment of animal auxiliaries such as dogs, horses, and camels. In their Balkan Empire, they adapted this lesson to take advantage of human auxiliaries, forcibly recruited from their Christian subjects.</p>
<p>The use of slaves as soldiers and administrators, exemplified by the Janissaries in the Ottoman case, was a critical factor in the maintenance of successful Nomad empires over sedentary populations. This approach had two significant consequences: it excluded the Osmanlis from any administrative and political responsibilities, leading to a degeneration of their moral fiber due to a lack of effective stimulus. The Janissaries could maintain their efficiency only as long as their numbers remained small, which itself presented a challenge. Eventually, the decline of public spirit among the ruling Osmanlis diluted the Janissaries, and the civilization represented by the Ottoman Empire ultimately expired as the "sick man of Europe" in 1918.</p>
<p>The Centaur, a figure representing the outsider view of the Nomad raider, symbolizes the return to animalism that constitutes another aspect of arrested civilizations. The reactive ability of these civilizations becomes concentrated on one mastered challenge, ultimately reducing and preventing proper responses to new challenges inherent in existence.</p>
<p>Utopias, by definition, seek to stabilize societies at a certain level and exemplify this tendency toward caste and specialization. Arrested civilizations thus contradict the notion of uniformity in the development of civilizations and the necessity for constant growth.</p>
<p>If growth is not a necessary condition for a civilization's existence but instead depends on a balanced response to a series of challenges, what then is its nature? Toynbee addresses this question through mythology. Aeschylus' "Prometheus Bound" symbolically represents the conditions of growth. After achieving dominance over Olympus, Zeus is primarily concerned with maintaining his power, as any change could detract from his absolute authority. # Aeschylus and Toynbee: Creativity and Civilization</p>
<p>Aided by his Titanic ally Prometheus, who embodies creativity and the essence of the Élan Vital, Zeus's struggle illustrates the conflict between thought and force. No amount of physical compulsion can prevail against the challenge of arrest. Ultimately, there is reconciliation; Zeus admits that creativity is essential for his survival, revealing that he had not been what he seemed.</p>
<p>Toynbee sees in Aeschylus' trilogy a poetic chronicle of Hellenic history. Just as Zeus avoided the fate of suppressed civilizations by being galvanized into activity, Prometheus's influence reflects that Hellas's growth is a testament to a series of successful responses to recurrent challenges.</p>
<p>The first challenge, posed by the barbarian highlanders, evoked a response of victory over the brigands. This victory determined that Hellas should become a world of cities and agriculture, rather than villages and pasture lands. However, the limit of maximum population density supportable by agriculture proved to be elastic. Initially, the wealth problem served as a stimulus for overseas expansion, but the impact of Hellenic imperialism prompted greater unity among the Mediterranean peoples and set effective limits to Greek colonization.</p>
<p>The challenge of overpopulation was ultimately addressed by Athens, which became known as the "education of Hellas." Under its guidance, Greek expansion transitioned to indirect methods, with commerce and production as the key means of continuing survival. Aeschylus' trilogy serves as a testimony to the intensity of the Athenian response. Growth, in Toynbee's framework, reveals itself as a process of successful responses to recurring challenges.</p>
<p>The optimum challenge stimulates a response that propels civilization beyond the point of exact balance--the condition of the arrested civilization--into a state of continuing disequilibrium. The transition from genesis to growth exhibits a repetitive rhythm in which equilibrium signifies breakdown.</p>
<p>Growth represents one aspect of the evolutionary process, achieving itself through ever-greater self-articulation and progressive mastery over the environment. Yet, what criteria exist for evaluating the growth of a civilization?</p>
<p>Does mastery over the environment pertain to the civilization's external relations or its inner self-determination? Toynbee rejects increased control over a civilization's human environment, expressed in terms of geographical expansion, as a criterion of growth. He argues that expansion often stifles the ability to respond creatively.</p>
<p>The archaic forms of Christianity manifest in the Catholicism of the Mississippi basin. The notion that geographical expansion retards social progress further explains why the most archaic forms of language often occur at the greatest distances from their origin.</p>
<p>Why does the era of greatest expansion coincide with the period of decline? Toynbee argues that "social radiation" obeys the same laws as light waves. During the growth phase, a civilization emits its influence uniformly, with cultural, political, and economic manifestations merging into a cohesive whole.</p>
<p>In contrast, the decline phase witnesses a diffraction of these rays into their component parts, allowing for the absorption of desirable emissions. The resistance to accepting an alien cultural pattern is much greater than the reluctance to adopt alien technologies.</p>
<p>The decaying civilization often succeeds in exerting influence on the economic level, sometimes on the political plane, but rarely on the cultural plane. Increasing command over the physical environment cannot serve as a criterion of growth for Toynbee, as it merely reflects another manifestation of an ego-centric delusion. In the current stage of Western civilization, a conception of history as a uniform development of increasing technical mastery fits too neatly with the prejudices of the age to be objectively valid. This contradicts the doctrine advocating for the stimulus of new ground. The danger of arguing from physical phenomena is discussed in the postscript to the Conclusions and leans heavily on Spengler.</p>
<p>Moreover, the division of history into periods distinguished by technological labels, such as the Bronze Age and Iron Age, lacks empirical support. At every stage, new techniques were likely the property of a creative few, from whom the rest of humanity acquired them through mimesis and a gradual process. Thus, the Paleolithic Age may never have existed as a distinct period. Historical evidence does not support a necessary connection between technical proficiency and a civilization's growth. The transition from the Paleolithic to the Neolithic Age saw improvements in technique alongside a degeneration of wisdom, ideation, and style.</p>
<p>The interregnum between the collapse of one civilization and the emergence of a new one also reveals a deficiency in inward stature, despite superior techniques. Such was the case with Rome. Improvements in agricultural techniques made large-scale agriculture profitable, leading to the introduction of plantation slavery in the Hellenic world. The destruction of the free peasantry and the consequential rise of a parasitic proletariat in Rome ultimately strangled Hellenic civilization.</p>
<p>Finally, technological improvements in military weapons remain relatively constant. Although this argument limits inferences drawn from universal consensus, it does not disprove the thesis of uniform progress. This argument applies only to the origination of the technique and does not address conditions following its general acceptance. Toynbee discusses this in Volume III, p. 173.</p>
<p>Increasing command over the environment, which proceeds inversely to a civilization's growth, does not reveal any criterion for progress; instead, it signifies a precondition for technological advancement. Toynbee identifies this in the law of progressive simplification, which posits that growth accompanies a continual economizing of means.</p>
<p>The operation of this law can be observed in the development of script, which progresses from the pictograms of Chinese to the hieroglyphics of Egypt, culminating in the Alphabet. In this Syriac invention, the introduction of auxiliary words has enabled Western languages to surpass in simplicity while equaling in expressive power the complex Arab verb forms. The progressive simplification of fashions parallels the economy of hypotheses for explaining natural phenomena. The Copernican system replaces the Ptolemaic system, accounting for the same range of phenomena in much simpler terms. Einstein, for example, has provided a theory that synthesizes the laws of gravity, radiation, and magnetism.</p>
<p>This simplification does not reveal a negation or omission; rather, it represents the liberation of energy for higher tasks. Its human representatives include Socrates, who in a Platonic dialogue shifts his focus from the physical to the psychic sphere.</p>
<p>Toynbee's normative pattern also illustrates this inner experience, as seen in Gandhi's appeal for a return to handiwork, symbolizing a spiritual plane. In its deepest sense, the process of etherealization demonstrates the gift of this field of activity from the macrocosm to the microcosm. Toynbee's criterion of growth applies to a progressive internalization of the field in which challenge and response occur. The growing civilization tends to become its own environment, and the subsequent ordeal takes place within its own body.</p>
<p>Thus, in Hellenic history, the earliest challenges arose from an external environment, represented by the Achaemenians and the Thracian barbarians. However, following the decisive defeat of the last Syriac power, Carthage, and the subsequent conquest of European barbarians, the external factors became less significant. The conflict shifted to internal fields, where the antagonism between the Oriental plantation slaves and their Roman masters equaled in intensity the passions engendered by the Punic Wars. Similarly, in the West, the external challenge from foreigners preceded the domestic issue of replacing the Feudal system with an organization of sovereign states. The most recent stage of Western history demonstrates, through the phenomenon of Bolshevism, the ultimate proof of its absorptive powerThe conflict shifted to the internal field, where the bitterness of the antagonism between the Oriental plantation slaves and their Roman masters equaled in intensity the passions engendered by the Punic Wars. The most recent stage of Western history exhibits, through the phenomenon of Bolshevism, the ultimate proof of its absorptive power.</p>
<p><strong>Toynbee, op. Vol. III, p. 197</strong></p>
<p>This contradicts the earlier assertion that overpopulation, an internal factor, constitutes the earliest challenge. The war communism that transferred Russia's capital to Moscow as a means of technique and electrification into the pattern of Western civilizations illustrates this. Thus, the challenge of Communism, which draws inspiration for economic self-sufficiency from Europe, is an internal problem of Western civilization. For Toynbee, growth constitutes a pattern of the progressive etherealization of challenge and response. The external factor constantly diminishes in importance, and the necessity of self-articulation becomes more pronounced. Growth is a process of increasing the range of self-determination, transferring the field of activity from the macrocosm to the microcosm. The laboratory represents the chronicle of that effort. If growth exhibits an increase in self-determination, by what mechanism does it accomplish itself? Toynbee examines two common arguments: the theory of the atomistic independence of individuals and the conception of society as a biological organism. He refutes the former by referring to the Odyssey's description of the Cyclops and the postulate that language, and therefore thought, can be developed only in society.</p>
<p>For the weakness of this argument, see post Conclusions. Toynbee confuses alien inspiration with an area of activity. Note the dependence of this concept on Hegel. He presents a super-organism without adducing any supporting data, except the assertion that man can act only as an individual, not as part of an organism. For Toynbee, society represents a community of individuals, each of whom constitutes a discrete field of activity. The areas at which the various fields of action intersect contain the political and social institutions of each civilization. A field of action obviously cannot serve as a source of action; rather, a relation merely provides the common ground for the encounter of several forces. Society serves as the medium of communication for the interaction of its components. Toynbee considers creativity the attribute of the individual.</p>

<p>For over two hundred years, Athens' role was the exact antithesis of its previous condition of apparent hibernation. The institutions developed during the withdrawal proved their superiority over their Spartan counterparts, which had broken down while Athens became the "education of elites." Similarly, England's insular position enabled her to find the solution to the most serious challenge of 17th-century Western civilization. By breaking down feudal barriers within her domain and substituting democratic government for aristocratic dominance, she achieved the transformation from an agricultural to an industrial society. When the Glorious Revolution brought England's return to the European scene, the Continental powers found there a model for their adaptation of Italian Transalpine efficiency to nation-states.</p>
<p>This, Toynbee believes, may be Russia's role in the Western world. The early Communist tendencies of absolute isolation may well constitute that withdrawal which finds the proper response to the all-pervasive Western challenge of nationalism. Brought by technology into the Western pattern, Russia will perform growth.</p>
<p>Growth accomplishes itself through the agency of a creative minority. It is difficult to see how Russia can serve as the creative minority of a civilization that meets Toynbee's every criterion for disintegration.</p>
<p>The withdrawal results in an inward tempering and becomes effective through its return, leading by social drill. In the absence of the direct inspiration that will be attained at the next level of integration, this presents a series of unique problems, each a challenge to undergo the ordeal. Moreover, the successful solution of one problem exposes the civilization to a new challenge, the nature of which is largely determined by the previous response.</p>
<p>Spengler asserted that each culture possessed a soul, which revealed itself in the selection of its appropriate symbolism and contained the key to the understanding of the culture's history. Toynbee denies this assertion. He opts for a willed direction based on a series of overbalances, each successful response creating a fresh challenge. Differentiation is achieved by growth, not through a determined process.</p>
<p>The growth of civilizations, in Toynbee's scheme, exhibits that purposiveness which his metaphysical assumptions postulate. The dependence of Toynbee's concepts on Dante is striking. Toynbee's precipice resembles nothing so much as Dante's Mount Purgatory. The direct mutual illumination in the new state of being parallels the ability of the denizens of Dante's Paradise to read each other's thoughts.</p>
<p>Yet again, the empirical method leads to the logical inconsistencies and philosophical difficulties observed previously. This etherealization exhibits the liberation of energy for higher works; however, this assertion finds no warranty in historical data.</p>
<p>Higher and lower, as Kant pointed out in his Refutation of Ethical Hedonism, do not constitute categories of empirical experience but normative patterns of rationality. On the other hand, empiricism sees etherealization as merely a technical transfer of a field of activity brought about by the physical expansion of civilization. In fact, Toynbee sways uneasily between his theological assertions.</p>
<h1 id="conception-of-inner-self-determination-and-the-eternalization">Conception of Inner Self-Determination and the Eternalization</h1>
<p>The conception of inner self-determination and the eternalization is a product of civilization's growth (Environmental). Toynbee, the empiricist, sees the problems of Western civilization as consequences of technological mastery, though the inconsistency in acknowledging that an improvement in technology accompanies simplification while considering Gandhi's return to the spinning wheel as a symptom of a yearning for simplicity cannot be overlooked.</p>
<p>Toynbee, the theologian, views the criteria of growth as emanations of the soul's self-articulation. What is the connection between these realms of necessity and freedom? Do arrested civilizations result from an insuperable challenge or a deficient response? Toynbee's criticism of Spengler is curiously inept. Surely Spengler's assertion of a culture as an organism did not mean that the culture and its component individuals constituted two mutually exclusive entities. Spengler would not deny that all activity presupposes individual volition.</p>
<p>The crucial question is whether this personal volition represents an```markdown ## Breakdown of Civilizations</p>
<p>The breakdown of civilizations, for Toynbee, cannot contain the sanction of an unavoidable fatality. If growth is a process of progressive etherealization, then breakdown must result from a failure of self-determination. A challenge that does not evoke a successful response constantly faces a failing civilization, threatening its existence. Under this impact, the reactive capacity of the civilization becomes exhausted, and the creative majority loses its appeal for the uninspired majority.</p>
<p>Mimesis breaks down, and society degenerates into antagonistic classes. To escape these tensions, the now-dominant minority develops a universal state as an instrument of repression. The internal proletariat expresses its frustration by creating a universal church, which serves as the repository of the meaning of history. This metaphysical dilemma ever accompanies Toynbee on his journey through history.</p>
<p>The difficulty of uniting normative concepts with empirical deduction becomes more pronounced. If all civilizations have collapsed or exhibit symptoms of breakdown, how can the necessity of a society's decline be consistently denied? Why is Christianity of absolute validity in a cosmology that produces higher religions as the accidental consequence of social breakdown?</p>
<p>These questions dominate Toynbee's analysis of the breakdown of civilizations. All civilizations that have existed have either broken down or exhibit symptoms of decay.</p>
<h2 id="1">1</h2>
<p>Surveys cannot draw conclusions from this phenomenon until all possible theories have been examined. Toynbee rejects the argument that the decline of civilizations results from a general aging of the earth, asserting the relative youth of the species in terms of its life span. The racial theory presents no greater difficulties. Based on Plato and Aristotle, it insists that all creative advances result from the infusion of virile blood into static civilizations, with decline stemming from the degeneration of this race. Thus, the Renaissance is conceived to be due to the Lombard invasions, the beneficial effects of which took several centuries to appear. Nevertheless, according to Toynbee, empirical data fails to support this thesis. The bloom of the Risorgimento occurred without any preceding barbarian invasion.</p>
<p>What of the cyclical theory? Does the repetitive movement of the stars find its counterpart in human history? At first blush, Toynbee's assumption of an elemental rhythm that expresses itself in alternate states of <em>Yin</em> and <em>Yang</em>, and <em>Withdrawal-and-Return</em> lends support to this thesis. However, Toynbee denies that this constitutes a correct inference. Though the shuttle that weaves the web of time moves up and down, its movements serve as the condition for the creation of a meaningful pattern. The wheel must turn in order to advance. Toynbee wavers on the question of Western civilization but seems to include it among the decaying societies. This seems an unhappy choice for the refutation of the very likely, untenable race theory. The Risorgimento is hardly comparable in creative effectiveness to the Renaissance.</p>
<p><em>Yin</em> and <em>Yang</em> do not disclose senseless cycles but requisites for the liberation of the Promethean Elan of creativity. Breakdowns of civilizations do not result from the oppression of cosmic forces but from factors within human consciousness. Yet what criteria for the evaluation of decline exist? Toynbee examines the relation of civilization to its physical and human environment. Loss of control over the physical environment does not cause the breakdown of a civilization. On the contrary, technique may improve in many fields long after the decline has set in. Wherever the command over the physical environment diminishes, it exhibits the consequences, not the cause, of social breakdown. The ability to construct roads did not decline after Marcus Aurelius, but Roman willingness to do so degenerated. The technical knowledge for draining swamps existed throughout Rome's history, yet the capacity to respond to this continuing challenge suffered, leading to a malaria-ridden Campagna.</p>
<p>Loss of command over the human environment also fails to qualify as a criterion for the breakdown of civilizations in Toynbee's scheme. Indeed, the early stage of decline reveals a significant increase in the mastery of the human environment.</p>
<p>This argument does not, however, refute the necessity of a civilization's decline. However purposeful the movement of the shuttle in objective terms, subjectively it involves the growth and decline of civilizations. These arguments are presented at such length because without a glimpse of his methodology, Toynbee's philosophy becomes meaningless.</p>
<p>As breakdown proceeds and the inner strength of society dissipates in domestic strife, the barbarians beyond the borders cease to be charmed by the civilization's creativeness and overrun large areas. This, again, is a result, not a cause, of the inner decline. The barbarians' appearance on the civilization's geographical field heralds the beginning of the time of troubles from which, in time, a new civilization emerges.</p>
<h2 id="4">4</h2>
<p>Similarly, Toynbee denies that the impact of an alien civilization may cause a society's breakdown. An alien civilization succeeds in making its domination effective only in the advanced stages of social breakdown. A society that has undergone a prolonged <em>"Time of Troubles,"</em> without being able to create a universal state, may welcome an alien intrusion that attends relief from intolerable warfare. This was the service performed by the Ottomans for the Orthodox-Christian civilization, which had broken down during the Bulgar wars of the 11th century. The internecine warfare of the subsequent centuries had not given way to the peace of a universal state, and in these circumstances, the Ottoman Empire represented a relief from an oppressive situation. This, too, according to Toynbee, seems the condition of Russia, Japan, and India, all of which achieved universal states under Western inspiration.</p>
<p>The human environment may absorb a society in two ways. The more painful process of separation and affiliation presents a victory through defeat, as the inner meaning of no civilization is salvaged through the agency of a universal state. The total absorption into an alien civilization, on the other hand, results in the atrophy of all cultural activity and breakdown.</p>
<p>If the breakdown of civilizations does not result from external factors, what accounts for the high incidence of fatalities among civilizations? Toynbee finds part of the answer in the faculty of <em>mimesis</em>.</p>
<p>"This social drill, the consequence of failure in the ability to absorb directly the inspiration of the saints, represents a shortcut fraught with dangers. Just as increased technological efficiency increases the responsibility of the engineer, so the faculty of mimesis becomes dangerous if directed outside the path charted by the creative minority. Mimesis is thus threatened by its mechanicalness. Tradition provides primarily the best guarantee for the safe direction of mimesis. As civilization, however, has broken the <em>"cake of custom,"</em> it is therefore forced to live dangerously, with the breakdown of tradition as its ever-present threat. Their dependence on mimesis exposes creative personalities to many dangers.</p>
<p>The leaders may become infected with the neotism they deliberately instilled in their followers, transforming purposeful advance into robot-like activity. The loss of creativeness destroys their claim to leadership. As the magic charm evaporates, the multitude that previously followed unquestioningly mutinies. Power replaces inspiration as the social ties. The exercise of force constitutes an abuse of trust which eventually dooms its perpetrators. The failure of the Promethean plan leads to a loss of harmony. Society articulates itself into classes and dissipates its strength in inner conflict.</p>
<p>The intractability of institutions provides another obstacle to the uniform growth of civilizations. The precept that the best adapted methods yield maximum results, contained in Christ's saying that new wine should not be placed in old bottles, can be successfully...<br />
```# Breakdown of Tradition</p>
<p>The precept that the best-adapted methods yield maximum results, contained in Christ's saying that new wine should not be placed in old bottles, can be successfully applied only in a family. Society, however, as the common ground of many persons' fields of action, severely limits the range of possible adaptation. Social readjustments have to contend with inertia that attempts at all times to keep the structure static. Creative forces can overcome these tendencies by gradual adjustment, eliminating the inelastic structure. The violent removal of the structure is revolution, a process of retarded mimesis.</p>
<p>According to Toynbee, this is the condition of arrested civilizations.</p>
<p>The intensity of this condition is proportional to the anachronism to be overcome. Social enormities utilize old institutions for purposes they were never meant to fit. If the response accomplishes itself through adjustments, growth is assured. Revolutions may assist growth by removing impediments to progress. Yet the resort to force ever constitutes a moral blight.</p>
<p>Enormities are the very embodiments of social breakdown; however, their perversion of institutions results in a rigidity of outlook that characterizes arrested and declining civilizations. Toynbee ascribes a large measure of the inconstancy of human fortunes--the recurrent growth and decline of civilizations--to the nemesis of creativity. Creative responses to successive challenges are extremely rare. Indeed, it seems that the successful solution of one problem severely limits the reactive capacity to the next ordeal.</p>
<p>The insight and uprightness that enabled the Pharisees to guide Jewry in its Babylonian captivity failed them when faced with the greater treasure of a supra-mundane kingdom promised by Christ. This, too, is the motif of the tragic drama that describes the sudden change in human fortunes to the envy of the gods. Herodotus' fable of the ring of Polycrates exhibits the sudden negation of being brought on by Divine disfavor. But in the legend of the end of Croesus emerges a deepening of understanding.</p>
<p>In Aeschylus, the total collapse of all human aspirations results not from the aberration of a fickle Deity but from a deficiency in the soul of the sufferer. Sin, not envy, dooms human endeavor. This sinner's blight follows an inner alienation from Divine love, which makes him unworthy to continue as God's instrument. The nemesis of creativity constitutes one aspect of this drama of the doom of Man, with God's role merely passive, revealing the inevitable consequence of sinful conduct.</p>
<p>This aberration accomplishes itself in two possible modes. The passive fault consists in resting on one's oars, in considering one's achievements a summit instead of a stepping stone, in worshipping Time instead of eternity. The adoration of a glorious past tends to induce passivity towards the tasks of the future, replacing the constantly true with the ephemeral.</p>
<p>The active aberration exhibits the denial of limit, rushing headlong into disaster, representing the psychological condition of being apoplexed by success, with annihilation as its consequence. Toynbee distinguishes several forms of idolatry. The idolization of an ephemeral self led Jewry to disaster. After having divined a truth of eternal validity in the sublimity of the One True God, Israel fell into the error of conceiving its temporary spiritual eminence as an eternal Divine sanction.</p>
<p>Worshipping a past greatness that had been sterilized by the self-adoration of the "Chosen People," Jewry was unable to accept the greater treasure offered to it by Christ. Thus, Israel atrophied while Christianity was preached by Galileans and accepted by Gentiles. Similarly, Athens had become the "education of Hellas" in the 5th and 6th centuries. But this magnificent success blinded Athenians to the import of new problems. The inadequacy of the polis organization as a stable base for further Hellenic growth was the most pressing challenge of the 4th century Hellenic civilization.</p>
<p>Athens could react only by attempting to assert a military hegemony, and the limit of her physical strength was quickly reached. The polis was finally transcended by peripheral powers, Macedonia and Rome, whose prospects had initially seemed much less bright than those of Athens. Moreover, the glory of philosophy evoked such idolization that the divine truth revealed by Paul fell on deaf ears in Athens. Enormities result from the idolization of an ephemeral institution exhibited by the limitations of the Greek city-states; this constant warfare led to the breakdown of Hellenic civilization.</p>
<p>The arrested civilizations testify to the final nemesis of idolatry, the idolization of ephemeral techniques. They possess biological counterparts in those organisms whose overly successful adaptation to an environment has accounted for their retardation on the evolutionary scale. In the industrial sphere, an initial technological advantage is often purchased at the expense of flexibility, exemplified by the gradual decline of Manchester's commercial position. The excessive reliance on an ephemeral military technique leads to the sudden collapse of that apparent colossus, of which David's encounter with Goliath is a reminder.</p>
<p>The Sanasid Empire succeeded in annexing most of Byzantium, a bureaucratic device in an agricultural society. The complexities of this constitute the mythological institution. Thus, Toynbee has accounted for three types of idolatry: the idolization of an ephemeral self, an ephemeral institution, and an ephemeral technique, all manifestations of the passive form of the nemesis of idolatry.</p>
<p>If idolatry exhibits the sin of resting on one's oars, the sin unfolds in three stages. It begins with the psychological condition of being spoiled by success. The consequent loss of mental and temporal balance results in a blind impulse that tempts the soul to attempt the impossible. Here, too, Toynbee distinguishes several forms. The suicidalness of militarism derives from an arrogance in the exploitation of success, which fails to appreciate the limits of its own physical strength. The hatred of the subject populations is compounded by the fear of all neighboring states; the decision to end the constant state of insecurity leads to the inevitable extermination of the militarist. This was the fate of Assyria, which escaped the nemesis of the idolization of an ephemeral technique, but whose recurrent resort to force caused a coalition of all neighboring societies to wipe it off the face of the earth.</p>
<p>The careers of Charlemagne and Timur Lenk reveal sharply the suicidalness of militarism. Their position as guardians of civilization's marshes had placed great opportunities within their grasp. The importance of border provinces derives from the intricate dynamics of power and influence that define the stability of empires.</p>

<p>This failing response may itself constitute the manifestation of an immanent decline. Toynbee's ambiguous postulation of purposiveness is compounded by his theory of society as a common field of activity. If the intractability of institutions results from the difficulty of modifying overlapping, dynamic fields, then the individual's freedom of action is severely limited.</p>
<p>The only portion left for purposiveness would be that part of a person's sphere outside the common field. Interaction must be, of necessity, small and insignificant.</p>
<p>Toynbee substitutes a mechanism for an organism, an immanent causality for an immanent destiny. Serious aspects of the nemesis of creativity serve as the critical underpinning.</p>
<p>The difficulty of writing the metaphysical assumptions with an empirical method constantly recurs. For what is the meaning of it in a pragmatic context? It never becomes clear whether Toynbee condemns the Athenians for failing to understand the profounder truth represented by Paul or for a faulty analysis of the wave of the future. No support can be found in historical data for the denial of the inexorability of decline in the face of the collapse of every heretofore existing civilization. The postulation of a One True God in Christianity, though a logical consequence of Toynbee's theology, rejects the very pattern of recurrence necessary to establish a historical law. For a God cannot be both exclusive and the accidental result of a civilization's decline. The deficiency of moral standards implied by the use of force may be well founded in theology, yet the only criterion empirical data admits is failure. And so Toynbee's ultimate proof resides in technical excellence, his final standard of values in the ability to prevail.</p>
<h2 id="the-disintegration-of-civilizations-schism-in-the-body-social">The Disintegration of Civilizations - Schism in the Body Social</h2>
<p>The breakdown of civilizations issues into disintegration if the capacity to react to challenges becomes permanently nullified. The sense of frustration in the body social leads to classes, the ever more violent conflict of which dissipates the strength of the civilization. The analysis of the disintegration of civilizations represents the culmination of Toynbee's philosophy, the revelation of his metaphysical doctrine. Out of the ashes of the City of Destruction emerges a profounder level of world experience, the supra-mundane level of reality. The period of breakdown had prevented the creative forces of the civilization from realizing their potentialities. Though this static condition exhibits a level of integration, its duration is ephemeral. Since it was attained outside of God's plan, this type of being cannot last. Against this negation of creativity, the secession of the internal proletariat constitutes a dynamic reaction. Being changes to becoming again. Humanity proceeds on its journey up the precipice. The universal church salvages the purposiveness in life, gives content to the void in the soul, and reveals truths of eternal validity.</p>
<p>Toynbee's metaphysical dilemmas are ever present, however. How can the accidental consequence of social breakdown embody the meaning of history? How can an empiricist evaluate the genesis or the sanction of evolution? Toynbee sways between the biological and the theological interpretation of history.</p>
<p>What are the possible inward reactions to a state of disintegration? Indeed, what does the soul's anguish matter except as it embodies itself institutionally? Toynbee's empiricism forces him to consider permanence a criterion for inward fitness. This decay of civilizations contains the moral sanction of history, from which man can learn rules not only for moral conduct but also for successful conduct. Does salvation or hope reside in phenomenal appearance or inner experience? It is the Kantian query again, the original dilemma restated, containing our metaphysical standard for the interpretation of Toynbee. If breakdown reveals a failure of self-determination, must it inevitably lead to disintegration?</p>
<h1 id="a-well-tried-empirical-method-for-a-solution">A Well-Tried Empirical Method for a Solution</h1>
<p>Just as birth is not necessarily involved in growth, breakdown does not inevitably lead to collapse. The alternative of disintegration is petrification, a state of creative impotence. Its dominant endless evenness of existence is characterized by philosophy and art languishing while natural science continues to grow. Growth reveals a process of differentiation. The uniqueness of each challenge is a function of the previous response.</p>
<p>For a full discussion, see the post "Conclusions" and Appendix A - The Concept of Meaning. This relies heavily on a combination of Spengler's Caesarism and failure-state, the key problems of his philosophy. Does growth assume the civilization's specific development and artistic style? The opposite holds true for disintegration. There, the failure to meet the problem results in the continuous confrontation of the same challenge. The unhappy soul struggles in each escape from defeat. For each unsuccessful response, there is an increment in the formidability of the challenge and a loss of capacity.</p>
<p>Toynbee finds one criterion for disintegration in the existence of a schism in the body social, an articulation into incompatible social groups. To be sure, the growth phase was also characterized by class distinctions. But its organization was hierarchical, with the common devotion to values constituting the bond, and the distinction into classes revealing merely a technical division of labor. Now, the claim of leadership evaporated, and the creative minority rules by force. The application of power provokes a violent response in the uncreative majority, which forms the internal proletariat. Beyond the civilization's border, an external proletariat threateningly faces the dominant minority. Any attempt to heal the schism in the body social is challenged.</p>
<p>Toynbee believes that the Marxian philosophy accurately describes the condition of a civilization moving towards collapse amidst an ever-greater accentuation of class oppositions. However, the Old Testament strain in Marx also pointed the way towards transcending this conflict, for the vision of the classless society reconciles all striving. Oppressors and oppressed will vanish, and harmony will reign everywhere. This intuition of peace through suffering, of happiness through agony, does not represent for Toynbee a bridging of the schism but its immanent purpose. This is <em>Palingenesis</em>, the new level of integration.</p>
<h2 id="schism-and-palingenesis">Schism and Palingenesis</h2>
<p><strong>Schism and Palingenesis</strong> appears, like Withdrawal and Return, as another beat of the elemental rhythm, of which Yin and Yang represent phases. It exhibits the mechanism by which the condition of dynamic activity maintains itself. The schism represents the withdrawal. The dominant minority, clinging to its position against all equity, has forced society into a static mold. The secession of the internal proletariat constitutes a dynamic response, disturbing the uneasy equilibrium.an ever greater accentuation of class oppositions.</p>
<p>The secession of the internal proletariat constitutes a dynamic response, disturbing the uneasy equilibrium. It withdraws to work out the solutions of the next phase of development. Its agony is shared by a small group of inspired personalities, the creative minority, which utilizes the faculty of mimesis to control the mass of the internal proletariat.</p>
<p>When the work of creation has proceeded and found its natural final embodiment in the universal church, Palingenesis engenders apprehension of a deeper meaning, the condition of a fresh advance. Each component of the disintegrating civilization develops a distinctive institution in response to the challenge of decline. The internal proletariat creates the Universal Church, the dominant minority founds the Universal State, and the external proletariat forms itself into barbarian war-bands. Each institution, moreover, allows for the articulation of an active and a passive set of attitudes. Its monopoly of force enables the dominant minority to establish the universal state as a response to the challenge of the internecine warfare of parochial states.</p>
<p>Toynbee distinguishes three characteristic human types as products of this military success:</p>

</table>
<p>The wastrel exemplifies the tremendous increase in the material scale of life brought about by territorial expansion. He appeared in the Roman aristocracy after the defeat of Hannibal and in the Pyramid builders of Egypt. The hangman is a familiar figure of the dominant minority of decaying civilizations, represented by Titus in the Hellenic civilization and ranging from the princes who consigned the Anabaptists to the pyre to the Hazis in Western civilization. Yet the dominant minority also produces different humanity after the intolerable "Period of Contending States." Though its existence is ephemeral, the universal state in full bloom develops administrators whose unselfishness and devotion to duty hide the inner weakness of all institutions. This was the condition of the Roman Empire in the 2nd century when the excellence of its civil service achieved the decisive bloom that really was that society's Indian summer.</p>
<p>Similarly, the changing ethos of the dominant minority in the West in the 20th century has replaced the blatant exploitation of colonial areas with at least lip service to the welfare of the indigenous population. The ethos of the administrator develops from the dominant minority's most spiritual creation, the school of philosophy. It transforms the Roman wolf into a Platonic watchdog. It weaves into the texture of the disintegrating society those moral concepts which represent the only enduring results of its existence. Yet the universal state is beyond salvation. The union between the dominant minority and philosophy is never complete.</p>
<p>The original sin of militarism constantly reappears, not to be avoided by even the most high-minded rulers such as Marcus and Julian. The schools of philosophy express an attitude born of desensitization, a reaction to the inadequacies of life. Detachment, the contemplation that knows no social responsibility, and the withdrawal conceived as an end, exhibit an inner sacrifice. They find refuge from the oppressive present in an assertion of determinism, of which the triumph of astrology in the Hellenic and Babylonian worlds furnishes the most notable examples. Philosophy does not represent the ultimate answer to the inner void of civilization. It may, however, assist the dialectical formulation of the only true.</p>
<h2 id="es-solution-the-higher-religion">ES Solution, the Higher Religion</h2>
<p>Finally, when disintegration has run its course, only the universal church remains as the chrysalis of a new civilization into the body of which the dominant minority merges and disappears. Toynbee conceives the internal proletariat as the product of a state of mind, not of an economic condition. It is inspired by a consciousness of having been deprived of its rightful place in the community, of being in but not of a society, of being unwanted and useless. Its resentment inspires a constant application of repressive measures which only serve to accentuate the rift.</p>
<p>All declining societies contain an internal proletariat recruited from three distinct sources:</p>
<p>| Source                                                                                                                                  |<br />
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | | The disinherited and uprooted members of its own body social                                                                             | | The partially disinherited components of alien conquered civilizations who are exploited in their native environment                       | | The doubly disinherited conscripts from subject populations whose exploitation involves their transplantation.</p>
<p>The destruction of the Hellenic peasantry by the introduction of the Latifundia is paralleled in the West by the pernicious consequences of the Enclosure movement. The indigenous Syriac internal proletariat of the Hellenic civilization has its counterpart in the Indian component of the Western Great Society. The institution of slavery blighted both civilizations. All the typical reactions of the dominant minority to the pervasive sense of futility manifest themselves in the internal proletariat as well. The arbitrariness of the rulers evokes the rebellion of the oppressed. The "violent" response, however, does not succeed because of the dominant minority's monopoly of power.</p>
<p>There seems to be no warrant for including India and other colonial dependencies in the Western society. The only connection between India and the West is on the technical (economic) and political plane. This, in Toynbee's terms, is a consequence of Western disintegration, not of Indian inclusion in the Western civilization.</p>
<h2 id="sicily-and-the-peasant-and-anabaptist-revolts">Sicily and the Peasant and Anabaptist Revolts</h2>
<p>Sicily and the peasant and Anabaptist revolts in the West emerge as an alternative response. The gentle attitude, exhibiting a pre-signal recognition of limits, issues in a religion that is faced with the crucial dilemma of its existence. It must decide whether to use its hold on the arts of the internal proletariat for the satisfaction of immediate political aims or whether to confine itself to the satisfaction of the greater spiritual wants.</p>
<p>Judaism chose the first alternative. Its nemesis became the futile search for a Messiah to actualize a parochial state. But Christ set Christianity firmly on the other path. His reprimand of Peter exhibits a final level of transcendental reconciliation that guaranteed the eventual triumph of Christianity. Similarly, Jewish survival was not assured until the realization that the Kingdom of God was not an external state and that man must abstain from all attempts to promote the Divine plan.</p>
<p>The spiritual superiority of the internal proletariat over the dominant minority becomes apparent in their comparative institutional embodiments. The universal state is a child of militarism; the universal church exhibits a new level of inner reconciliation. The dominant minority's gentle response issues in a philosophy which preaches <em>Detachment</em> as the highest state of bliss and an idolatrous religion of self-worship in the form of the <strong>Divus</strong> cult.</p>
<h2 id="toynbee-op-v-p-75">Toynbee op. V. p. 75</h2>
<p>This is a good illustration of Toynbee's normative concepts. Toynbee identifies many symptoms of disintegration within Western civilization as well. The dominant minority has failed to resolve the problem of internecine warfare among various states, the increasing violence of which multiplies the number of nation-states. Conversely, the internal proletariat, after its failed violence during the Peasants' Revolt, has learned, in many respects, the ways of gentleness. The Quakers illustrated through their prosperity that <em>"the meek shall inherit the earth"</em> and that <em>"honesty is the best policy. "</em> The violence of Marxism has been tempered until it has transformed into a reflection of the dominant minority's totalitarian worship of the state. However, the miracle of Christianity represents the deepest manifestation of Western gentleness. In the souls of races long removed from slavery, Christianity has been revitalized and has become a living force. The grip of the neopagan dominant minority is visibly lessening, and hope again flows through the trenches of Western Christendom. Toynbee expressed the belief that this teetering civilization, which has been reduced to its current state by the intoxication of victory over physical nature, may become the first to escape its nemesis and find peace through gentleness and life through Christ.</p>
<p>The external proletariat constitutes itself in response to the waning inspiration of civilization. During the growth phase, the barbarian's mimesis was directed toward the creative minority's cultural achievements. The area of contact between the two societies had been fluid, with the extent of cultural radiation determined by the civilization's inner energy. However, the emergence of the dominant minority sees a secession by the barbarians, who now form the external proletariat. The situation becomes fixed, and the two antagonists face each other across a line in an uneasy truce before the inevitable clash.</p>
<p>The external proletariat may continue to adopt the civilization's still superior techniques, but the inner relationship has ceased, and conflict is the unavoidable climax. The external proletariat possesses effective means of physical resistance. In contrast to the internal proletariat, the majority is exposed to all the necessities of creativity, while the external proletariat gains strength from the ranks of increasingly embittered barbarians. Violence is therefore the most typical reaction of the external proletariat. Its institutional embodiment is the barbarian war-bands, whose penetration of civilization's territory heralds the beginning of the interregnum. The external proletariat's religion reflects its change of outlook, emphasizing procreation and military defense as the most important aspects. Thus, the Goddess of fertility constitutes the primary religious symbolism of the earliest stage of development, while the God of destruction plays a very subsidiary role. The emergence of a military frontier engenders a social revolution. The community's energies are henceforth directed towards conquest, resulting in a consequent inversion of the relative importance of procreative and destructive activities. The God of war emerges as the Divinity towards which the worship of the external proletariat begins to be directed, a testament to its choice of the attitude of violence.</p>
<p>The Homeric poems testify to a profundity of vision that was to be repeated in the English and Scandinavian epics. The ex-barbarian war bands have accepted the universal church of the internal proletariat and, under its gentle guidance, have created their civilization. The history of the external proletariat reveals the ultimate victory of Gentleness over Violence. Even this period is not without its creativeness.</p>
<p>The City of Destruction appears as ephemeral as the universal state, and out of its ashes rises the inner meaning of history, to which even the barbarians must bow: the Universal Church. The analysis of the disintegration of civilizations exhibits the happiest application of Toynbee's pragmatic method, for the inner contradictions of his metaphysical pattern are here at a minimum. Whatever the cause of society's breakdown, its issue into disintegration discloses that inevitability, that "standardization," for the apprehension of which an empirical approach is ideally suited. All disintegration proceeds through the agency of a dominant minority, a seceding internal proletariat, and invading barbarian war-bands. The schism in the body social is palpable; the possible reactions to this dilemma are limited and confined to alternative violent or gentle responses. However, only the gentle responses contain the seeds of creativeness; only the Universal Church possesses a future. Yet even here, Toynbee's normative pattern and its irreconcilability with the historical data emerge. The truth of the Universal Church seems, in the final analysis, merely founded on its future, while the evil of the repressive measures of the universal state lies in their futility.</p>
<p>"Honesty is the best policy" becomes, in Toynbee's interpretation of the Quakers, primarily a maxim of prudent conduct. It is not apparent whether an inner attitude or a physical location characterizes the internal proletariat.</p>
<h2 id="proletarization-and-geography">Proletarization and Geography</h2>
<p>The proletarization by willed secession and the recruitment of the proletariat support the theory of geographical accident. The miracle of Christianity may cause its embodiment in the Universal Church of a second decaying civilization, but this can have no bearing on the fate of Western civilization. For the essence of a Universal Church is the supra-mundane plane of reality. Its full meaning is only realized after disintegration has run its course and barbarian war bands have toppled the City of Destruction. Christianity could then become the chrysalis in Toynbee's scheme of a new civilization. However, its conception as the material salvation of the West repeats the very sin for which Toynbee castigates Athens: the idolization of an ephemeral self.</p>
<p>The mere description of the institutional manifestations of disintegration can never, for Toynbee, exhaust the essence of the process. Just as growth was revealed as a rhythm of progress and breakdown resulted from a failure to respond successfully to recurrent challenges, so disintegration conceals a deeper meaning. The schism in the body social represents merely a symptom of that profounder schism of the soul, which is the real cause of society's collapse.</p>
<p>The growth phase of the civilization had witnessed a consistent...</p>
<h2 id="directedness-in-all-fields-of-behavior-feeling-and-life">Directedness in All Fields of Behavior, Feeling, and Life</h2>
<p>With disintegration, the possible reactions become polarized into inconclusive alternatives. A choice between the active and the passive option is the only freedom left to the soul that has lost its creativeness and participates, either as a villain or a victim, in social disintegration. This aspect of Toynbee's philosophy results in a total breakdown of his method. The state of a soul is approachable in terms of a categorization of states of mind that are really generational theological viewpoints and cannot claim to base itself on the surface manifestations of phenomenal appearance.</p>
<p>The full implications of Toynbee's concept of the Promethean plan reveal themselves. Its immanent working had always seemed to respond. It now appears that any conscious attempt to change the present condition constitutes the sin of archalism or futurism, the penalty for which is disintegration. We are back with Hegel's "whatever is, is right." We have not really transcended Spengler; the problem of freedom and necessity remains unsolved. Disintegration reflects the schism in a soul that has destroyed its creativity and whose collapse is approaching amidst gnawing frustration. Every aspect of life exhibits this inward dilemma; no part of society can escape it.</p>
<p>Yet since the problems faced by each component vary, the schism will reveal itself in a different form in the typical reactions of each class. Toynbee distinguishes several symptoms of inward frustration on the planes of behavior, feeling, and life.</p>
<h2 id="on-the-plane-of-behavior">On the Plane of Behavior</h2>
<p>The loss of creativity evokes the alternatives of tension and self-control, each an attempt to coax out of nature the inspiration that has been wantonly destroyed. While the dominant minority endeavors to recapture the charm of its youth, either by giving reign to the passions or by strict control, the internal proletariat seeks a substitute for the lost art of mimesis. The lack of leadership accentuates the inner helplessness of the mass. Its alternatives are truancy and martyrdom: a shirking of responsibility made possible by the breakdown of discipline or a conscious quest for a death that will finally end all uncertainty.</p>
<h2 id="on-the-plane-of-feeling">On the Plane of Feeling</h2>
<p>The reactions occur in response to a reversal of the Promethean elan by which growth had accomplished itself. The sense of drift exhibits the passive response, a resignation to the enigmatic universe that accentuates the impotence of man. When the failure of growth is accompanied by a cessation of the differentiation that had produced the civilization's style, the sick soul loses its sense of form and gives vent to a feeling of promiscuity, expressed in the blending of incompatible elements and the emergence of a cosmopolitan language, the syncretism of religion and philosophy.</p>
<p>Yet the profounder souls of society sense a deeper meaning in the loss of style, an apprehension of unity behind the growth and decay of ephemeral institutions. The sense of unity conjures a cosmos of eternal validity out of the chaotic appearance of the phenomenal world.</p>
<h2 id="archaism-and-futurism">Archaism and Futurism</h2>
<p>Archaism and futurism constitute the violent options, a projection of longing and endeavor that causes a violent eruption of the pent-up frustration and seals the doom of society. When all material hopes are disillusioned, the gentle response re-emerges: the recognition by man of his limits, the humility which transcends itself, and the faith that moves mountains.</p>
<h2 id="detachment-and-transfiguration">Detachment and Transfiguration</h2>
<p>Detachment and transfiguration, the bliss of contemplation and the salvation through God's love, appear as the guarantee, at the eleventh hour, of the continuation of the meaning of life. Any society contains creative personalities, agents of imamic activity, embodiments of the new level of Yin. But a disintegrating society offers no obvious field of activity for leadership. Mimesis has broken down, and attempts at revitalization are bound to be tentative and uncertain. As the schism in the soul of civilization becomes wider, the inspired individuals appear in the role of saviors, their effectiveness determined by the attitude of life they represent. For <em>Gentle Will</em> always triumphs over <em>Violence</em>, <em>peace</em> over <em>discord</em>, and <em>materialism</em>. God's love, the motive force of the universe, shines as a beacon of mercy through the gloom of collapse.</p>
<h2 id="abandon-and-self-control">Abandon and Self-Control</h2>
<p>Abandon and self-control constitute Toynbee's conception of the reactions of a soul which attempts to claim the sanction of nature for the absence of its creativeness.</p>

<h2 id="truancy-and-martyrdom">Truancy and Martyrdom</h2>
<p>Truancy and martyrdom represent the alternatives by which a leaderless mass seeks to find a substitute for the loss of direction induced by the collapse of mimesis. Just as in any society, the relaxation of discipline offers a moral excuse for the shirking of danger, so truancy in a disintegrating society appears as an alternative to the purposiveness which has become regressive. This was the reaction of <em>Sparta</em> and <em>Athens</em> at a time when only unity could prevent a Roman hegemony over Greece.</p>
<p>This is the meaning of the "irreligious toleration" of the West, which has cut itself off from its spiritual heritage and substituted a secular idol in the form of the national state for the spiritual basis of its greatness. Yet the specter of defeat may cause other minds to attempt to salvage their ideals by courting death without any hope of material reward.</p>
<p><em>Socrates</em> refused all chances to play truant and met a martyr's death. In its hour of trial, the <em>Christian church</em> steadfastly refused the very tempting and very easy escape of formal allegiance to the <em>Divus</em>. The blood of her martyrs furnished the condition of her eventual triumph.</p>
<p><em>Ja¢ Moore</em> chose death rather than the ignominy of treachery.</p>
<p>Toynbee turns next to an examination of the impact of disintegration on the plane of feeling. The loss of the Promethean elan of growth faces the soul with the very negation of existence, from which the sense of drift and the sense of sin represent antithetical methods of refuge. The feeling of drift wears as the consequence of an idolatry of Necessity or Chance.</p>
<h2 id="necessity-and-chance">Necessity and Chance</h2>
<p>While an idolatry of Fate may be prevalent, it is usually an amalgam of the successful methods of neighboring civilizations.</p>
<p>An extensive dilution accompanies the expansion of the army, the insatiable requirements of which are the consequence of the campaigns for attaining the universal state. Common military service vulgarizes the dominant minority. The lack of inward strength forces the dominant minority to follow the immediate trend.</p>
<p>When Christianity was small and without popular support, the persecutions of Rome were persistent, if half-hearted. But once Christianity achieved a position of eminence, the dominant minority reluctantly followed the internal proletariat's lead by announcing its own conversion. The dominant minority's barbarization matches its vulgarization. The establishment of a military frontier across which the external proletariat ever threatens to erupt testifies to this fact.</p>
<p>This, of course, may be the secret of their success.</p>
<p>To a barbarian war-band's feat of arms. Since the moral fiber of the dominant minority is steadily degenerating, the balance along these lines inclines in the barbarian's favor. The attempt to solve this challenge by enrolling the barbarian war-bands in the universal state's military service ends with the dominant dooming their present improvisators to sterility.</p>
<p>In the field of language, the sense of promiscuity reveals itself in the replacement of local distinctiveness by a general confusion of tongues. The requirements of communication in a universal state lead to the emergence of a lingua franca, such as Aramaic and Latin in the Hellenic world, and English in Western civilization.</p>
<p>Religious syncretism, too, is a manifestation of the sense of promiscuity that arises from the schism of the soul in an age of disintegration. The history of all universal states exhibits a convergence towards a common type in both religion and philosophy. The Stoa dominated all philosophic discussion during Rome's last centuries, and there was little difference between the various religious cults. The final manifestation of the sense of promiscuity is the church. Philosophy offers little more than the dialectic underpinning for the proper formulation of church dogma.</p>
<p>The oppressiveness of the void in the souls of both the dominant minority and the internal proletariat, along with the similarity of their frustration, will necessarily issue in a common religious experience, too exclusively directed towards the intellectual faculties. The universal church attains that depth of understanding which enables it to serve as a repository of all the hopes and the guarantor of the fulfillment of the disintegrating civilization.</p>
<p>Since Toynbee postulates alternative responses to the frustrations of feeling, the sense of promiscuity cannot constitute the only reaction to the civilization's loss of style. While the blending of all forms during the period of disintegration exhibits to weak souls an immanent chaos, a steadier spiritual vision may regard this trend as the revelation of an underlying unity. The phenomenal world reveals flickering manifestations that only serve to hide the eternal truth just below the surface.</p>
<p>The first intuition of the sense of unity arises through the appearances of the universal state. The Saviour with the sword strives for that unification of mankind, which Alexander denoted with concordia. However, the violence surrounding its creation seals the doom of the universal state. It is ever plagued by the militarism that created it, both externally through constant warfare and internally through the intermittent persecution of its minorities. Its inner contradictions magnify the apprehension of unity in the hearts of the members of the internal proletariat, whose specific national existence has been destroyed.</p>
<p>The religions of even primitive societies reveal the truth that the terrestrial plane can never satisfy man's striving for universality, expressed in the solitary nature of the savage's soul with the tribal God in a superhuman dimension. Mundane universality cannot achieve the unity of brotherly love without the common recognition of the kingdom of God. The gradual realization of the importance of the celestial.</p>
<p>The Tribal God</p>
<p>Whose initial function had consisted of the protection of physical existence now becomes the sole guarantor of tribal individuality, the chief hope for deliverance. Since conditions clearly do not warrant the expectation of liberation, the apocalyptic vision of a God arises, whose Judgment contains the moral sanction of history. The immediate attainment of material hopes is renounced, though the ultimate realization of the exclusive validity of the supra-mundane plane awaits a profounder vision.</p>
<p>Two conceptions of unity permeate the universal state, derived from its political organization. The omnipotence of the ruler leads to the exaltation of the transcendence of God and, by the conformity of justice to the postulation of the Supremacy of Law. The dominant minority is acutely conscious of this potency but is a force in itself. With the exaltation of Law, the personality of God grows progressively fainter. This was the condition of the Achaemenian Empire, of Babylon, and of the West since the triumph of Physical Science.</p>
<p>The other representation of the unity of the Universe as the work of an omnipotent God, with the Law as merely an emanation of God's will, discloses the typical reaction of the internal proletariat. The various tribal Gods of the subject internal proletariat tend to develop a standard type, for they are now alike exposed to the oppression of the same human monarch.</p>
<p>In the contest of the Gods of the internal proletariat, the most exclusive God usually triumphs, for in his exclusiveness resides the proof of his living existence, and in his jealousy the certainty of maintaining an unimpaired identity. Thus, Yahweh outran his competitors for the soul of the internal proletariat of the ancient world, enabling Christianity to develop its apprehension of the unity of One True God into a universal church.</p>
<h2 id="two-pairs-of-violent-and-gentle-responses">Two Pairs of Violent and Gentle Responses</h2>
<p>Here, however, two pairs of violent and gentle responses arise, each containing an antinomy of possible attitudes. Archaism and futurism constitute the violent pair.</p>
<p>Archaism appears as the Golden Age. It operates in the context of the reforms furnishing outstanding examples. Its institutional manifestations proceed on the assumption that the organs of social life can be remade by fiat. Thus, Hitler rearranged the German administrative map, and Peter the Great westernized Russia.</p>
<h2 id="futurism-fares-better-than-it-has-any-right-to-expect">Futurism "fares better than it has any right to expect"</h2>
<p>cit., Vol. VI, p. 635.</p>
<p>Futurism constitutes the reaction of a transplanted internal proletariat, prevented forever from returning to its former state, and is made into physical revolt by the dominant minority's oppression. It sets an apocalyptic vision before its eyes to take nothing less than an inversion of the present order, a change of roles between the slaves and the masters. This was the Jewish reaction to the Roman and Persian occupations, conjuring up a Messiah who would transform agony into bliss by the establishment of an Israeli Commonwealth. The mundane world remained the center of hope. It took the catastrophic defeats of the Maccabees to teach Jewry the lesson of deeper spiritual insight--the recognition that the True Kingdom of God does not lie in this world.</p>
<p>This intuition is transfiguration, the apprehension of the supra-mundane plane of reality. The practitioners of archaism and futurism appear on the scene as saviors with the time machine. They arise in all classes of the disintegrating society. The external proletariat develops its savior-archaists who seek to return to the happy days before civilization's impact, and whose reaction is violent. The dominant minority also produces savior-archaiasts. If they act in the field of foreign relations, their policy results in a fiasco, such as Justinian's attempt to revive the lost glory of the Western Roman Empire.</p>
<p>When they attempt to remedy the desperate enterprises, acts of full disillusionment reveal social conditions, and they are disowned by their own class, for the internal proletariat's loss has been the dominant minority's gain. These outlaw saviors frequently include some of the noblest souls of the dominant minority, joyously reformed under their influence. The disappointment of the internal proletariat's futuristic hopes is given meaning by these outlaw saviors. The City of Destruction is transcended, and the City of Hope is brought into view.</p>
<p>Archaism and futurism reveal a pair of violent responses to the emptiness of life. <em>Detachment</em> and <em>Transfiguration</em> furnish gentle variations in Toynbee's scheme. Just as the experience of the impracticability of futurism leads to self-transcendence, so the frustration of archaism issues in the philosophy of <em>Detachment</em>. The sorrow of a disintegrating society is evaded by a withdrawal from life, a quest for salvation through meditation. It finds bliss in a will-less resignation, an escape from existence in which Death appears as welcome oblivion.</p>
<p><em>Detachment</em> implies not only a rejection of life but a love of its negation; as an intellectual achievement, Toynbee suggests this philosophy imposes moral consequences that are repulsive. For detachment implies a purging of all passions.</p>
<p>The state ideal of indifference to suffering, repeated in Buddhism, involves the reason for the defeat of detachment. By appealing to the head to the exclusion of the heart, the philosopher tears asunder what God has joined together. For attempting to divine this truth, the philosophy of detachment is superseded by the mystery of transfiguration.</p>
<p>The philosopher marked by a king represents Toynbee's conception of the creative personality of this attitude of life. The ambiguity of his position dooms the philosopher's endeavor. The universal state in which such individuals appear is the product of force, and the sin of violence ever haunts its steps. Even if the sword is temporarily sheathed, internal tensions will force its reappearance. Indeed, the Platonic philosophy implies the necessity of the use of force. Though basing the republic on a recognition by everyone of the division of labor, Plato negates this lip service to popular consent by uniting the executive and the military. The philosopher's direct inspiration can reach but a few; leadership of a social organization must always rely on mimesis. The philosopher masked by a king can provide the real savior of society. By acting politically, he trespasses on the king's proper field of ruthless deeds, while the king stultifies himself in attempting to practice detachment.</p>
<p>This seems to confirm Sorel's two worlds: World-as-History and World-as-Nature.</p>
<h1 id="seo-post-conclusions">Seo Post Conclusions</h1>
<p>The individual who has embarked on the path of a disintegrating society possesses a surer hope and, consequently, a deeper happiness than the merely 'once-born' member of a mundane society still in growth. This individual has learned the saving truth that the Most High has not made one world, but...</p>
<h1 id="toynbees-journey-through-history">Toynbee's Journey through History</h1>
<p>Toynbee's journey through history culminates in a paean of evangelicalism, a rejection of This World, and a hope for salvation through Christ. The theological foundation of his philosophy emerges with full clarity. The defeated soul of a disintegrating civilization has exhausted all alternatives for healing its wounds. This healing is not attained in this world but results from a recognition of the Kingdom of God, which has infinite extent and eternal duration.</p>
<p>This experience is Transfiguration, an emanation of God's love, representing the apprehension of the supra-mundane plane of reality. Its achievement, along with the recognition of the subsidiary importance of This World, does not constitute an act of truancy but rather a withdrawal according to a divine plan; in this plan, God incarnate as Man, the Saviour, leads humanity towards a New Jerusalem.</p>
<p>The reliance on Dante is evident. With transfiguration, the Pilgrim reaches Paradise, where his mind becomes one with the Love of God, and terrestrial bonds fall away. In this state, everything is blissful, with will and necessity harmonized, Time at a standstill, and Space no longer an obstacle. The greater <em>truth</em> becomes apparent: the insignificance of mundane affairs and the transcendental reprieve God offers to those who repent. However, the novelty of this conception is marred by an empirical method that recognizes no mysteries and imposes causal patterns on all spiritual manifestations. The alternative ways of behavior, feeling, and life are metaphysical expressions of a theological viewpoint that cannot be supported by any amount of empirical data, including Christ's moral readiness to sacrifice Himself.</p>
<p>This represents a superiority in the "Battle of the Gods," derived from a value judgment rather than a necessary conclusion drawn from historical events. Peter's shearing off of beards better illustrates the frustration of empirical documentation, which must confine itself to mere phenomenal appearances that reflect the noumena, the soul. The assertion of purposiveness in the first five volumes has disappeared. Nothing can truly save This World. Indeed, should it be saved? For only through the disintegration of civilizations, in Toynbee's terms, does Man learn to know God, unless, of course, one attempts to equate morality with success. See the post "Conclusions" for a full discussion of these points.</p>
<h1 id="toynbees-philosophy">Toynbee's Philosophy</h1>
<p>Toynbee's philosophy represents an attempt to transcend the conception of history as an organism continuously reproducing new manifestations of power. The inevitability of decline and the inexorability of development through determined stages are replaced by an assertion of purposiveness. Challenge and response represent the mechanism by which growth accomplishes itself, reflecting the intrusion of an alien element into the perfection of creation, a fall that evokes a new phase of activity. History exhibits a continual alternation of static repose and creativity, of integration and differentiation, of Yin and Yang. All progress results from civilizations whose birth heralds a new stage in an evolutionary rhythm that permeates all existence.</p>
<p>Civilizations are not organic beings whose destinies determine their histories; they are merely fields of activity. The limitations of space have forced me to confine this discussion to a critique of Toynbee's philosophical position and those concepts central to his scheme. Therefore, I have not explored inconsistencies that do not affect Toynbee's central argument, such as his hint that Hussila may represent the new creative minority of the West while simultaneously implying that the West is in a state of breakdown. A similar contradiction arises in the argument that geographical expansion accompanies breakdown, conflicting with a previous description of the stimulus of new ground.</p>
<p>Toynbee demonstrates that a civilization's influence over neighboring societies is greatest during its period of decline. At the same time, he includes India in Western civilization due to her adoption of Western technology. While these inconsistencies reflect on Toynbee's precision of thought, they do not invalidate his central position. (For my criteria, see Appendix A - The Concepts of Meaning. For other inconsistencies, refer to my footnotes on previous sections.)</p>
<p>The Common Ground of Action</p>
<p>The common ground of action among their constituents expresses itself in the direction of <em>mimesis</em>, a social skill that serves as a substitute for the direct absorption of inspiration from the creative minority. Yet the process of growth remains fraught with dangers--<em>mimesis</em> breaks down due to its mechanical nature, and the creative minority succumbs to the nemesis of idolatry of the ephemeral rather than the eternally true.</p>
<p>Civilizations do not break down because of an inevitable fatality but rather commit suicide. The repeated failure to respond to a challenge leads to disintegration, the first manifestations of which appear as a schism in the body social. The creative minority substitutes force for charm, evoking a correspondingly violent reaction from the seceding internal proletariat. The barbarians beyond the borders constitute an external proletariat whose constant threat across a military frontier gradually saps the energy of the dominant minority.</p>
<p>The schism in the body social parallels a schism in the soul. All alternative ways of behavior, feeling, and life are doomed. Then, from the collapse of material hopes arises the vision of the ultimate meaning of human suffering, the true embodiment of historical existence: the Kingdom of God, with Christ as King. The soul that has defeated itself on the mundane plane understands the permanence of God's love and, through repentance and humility, may find its way to salvation.</p>
<p>Toynbee's common-sense approach, which claims to derive conclusions from a vast and impressive collection of empirical data, obscures great complexities. The incommensurability of his metaphysics and empirical data, as well as the logical antinomy of his position, manifests at every stage of Toynbee's work.</p>
<p>The realm of theology and the field of natural laws can be reconciled only with extreme difficulty. Does history reveal the gradual unfolding of a divine purpose, or is history a natural force obeying well-understood laws of evolution?</p>
<p>These three questions illustrate Toynbee's conflicting tendencies. The assertion of purposiveness in the first two volumes soon reveals itself as merely the emanation of a biological evolutionary development that proceeds from Yin to Yang, from Integration to Differentiation. In these terms, Challenge and Response constitute only beats of an elemental rhythm and a description of the operation of inevitability, not a denial of its necessity.</p>
<p>Toynbee's metaphysical assumptions derive from a theology in the medieval tradition of Dante, in which Love constitutes the creative force of the universe, and This World is conceived as preparation for the Kingdom of God. For this reason, he attributes the evolutionary manifestations of the Elan Vital to a specific criticism that rejects militarism as an original sin in the context of the Kingdom of God. The criticism of typical attitudes of a soul is less a description of the alternatives of a grating society than a denial of the substantiality of secular activity. In the final analysis, only the Kingdom of God matters. Mundane success conceals the inner hollowness of political institutions, whose existence ever depends on violence.</p>
<p>The difficulties## The Difficulties</p>
<p>Toynbee's analysis tends to obscure its methodological shallowness. Empirical analysis relies on a recognition of recurrent situations, while the formulation of laws requires a comparability of phenomena. The inner meaning of these manifestations cannot be fully captured by Toynbee's categories of archaism, futurism, and promiscuity. It is evident that all activity must fit one of these classifications. For example, Toynbee castigates the Renaissance for its traditionalism and the modern West for its rejection of traditional art styles. Similarly, Peter's reforms in Russia, Japan's modernization, and Napoleon's administrative reforms are criticized as symptoms of suicidal militarism, while the retention of the British King and the organization of the Parliament of Westminster on the basis of territory instead of corporations is described as an emanation of an archaism doomed to self-destruction.</p>
<p>In calculations, the uniqueness of experience constitutes a contradiction in terms. An empirical method is therefore unsuitable for demonstrating a theological view, which must necessarily rest on a transcendental experience. To be sure, a theological view can be demonstrated. However, its formulation derives, in the first instance, from a frank recognition of a normative pattern and a profound metaphysics.</p>
<p>Two consequences result from Toynbee's attempt to combine the theological and biological approaches. Survival, which in evolutionary development becomes the only criterion of inner fitness, is given divine sanction. Sin denotes the causality of dutiful failure, which constitutes the phenomenon's manifestation. Success represents the reward for moral action. This Calvinist concept serves as an example of the utilization of mundane success.</p>
<p>Of even the concept of Transfiguration, see the following quote from Toynbee, Vol. VI, p. 321:</p>
<p>"What response to this challenge is Christian to make? Is he going to look this way or that as if he would run, yet stand still because he cannot tell which way to go until the fire from heaven duly descends upon the City of Destruction and the wretched hoverer perishes in a holocaust which he has so dismally foreboded without ever bringing himself to the point of fleeing from the wrath to come? Or will he begin to run and run on crying 'Life! Life Eternal Life!' with his eyes set on a shining light and his feet bound for a distant wicked gate? If the answer to this question depended on nobody but Christian himself, our knowledge of the uniformity of human nature might induce us to predict that Christian's imminent destiny was Death and not Life. But in the classic version of the myth, we are told that the human orator was not left entirely to his own resources in the hour that was decisive for his fate. According to John Bunyan, Christian was saved by his encounter with the Evangelist. And, inasmuch as it cannot be supposed that God's nature is less benevolent than man's, you may and must pray that a reprieve which God has granted to society once will not be refused if we ask for it again with a contrite spirit and with a broken heart."</p>
<h2 id="philosophy-of-history-based-on-theology">Philosophy of History Based on Theology</h2>
<p>This is, of course, not inconsistent with an assertion of purposiveness, for the only indication of God's favor in a world of dark uncertainties is the temporal eminence achieved by strenuous prayer. It does, however, define morality in terms of ability.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the impossibility of uniting general law with the unique merit of Christianity results in a rejection of phenomenal reality. All possible attitudes towards life are seen to fail in achieving that permanence which alone can indicate the attainment of the Kingdom of God. Throughout Toynbee's analysis of the schism in the soul, the tendency to reject all worldly ambition as sham becomes more pronounced. The doom of humanity, the transitoriness of existence, and the unresolved mystery of the decline of civilizations all derive meaning from the affirmation of the eternal validity of the Kingdom of God.</p>
<p>The biological and theological views are found to be irreconcilable; after all, the <em>élan vital</em> operating through a challenge-and-response leads a succession of climbers upwards.</p>
<p>The precise path towards a ledge where the species becomes transformed into superman and the inspiration of mundane creative activity is unnecessary. Yet the failure to successfully reach a new level of integration produces, as a concomitant of disintegration, the universal church, the repository of the only true wisdom.</p>
<p>At this point, see Friedrich - <em>Inevitable Peace</em> - p. 111. Also, Friedrich - <em>Althusius</em>. See ante for my criticism of this concept. Qv Toynbee op. Vol. VI.</p>
<p><em>B40</em> - near the beginning of existence. This implies that either the evolutionary process is a chimera, the very unattainability of which teaches man his limitations, or that the new state of being, by definition, excludes the necessary validity of the higher religion.</p>
<p>A compromise between these two attitudes is possible. The pervasiveness of the elemental rhythm reduces the universal church to the incidental by-product of disintegration. The eternal applicability of Christianity denies the substantiality of worldly endeavor and makes the precipice a stage of transitory futility. If man succeeds in transforming himself, he will never have known a higher faith. The appearance of religion, again, signals the doom of worldly endeavor.</p>
<h2 id="tragedy-in-toynbee">Tragedy in Toynbee</h2>
<p>Is it the birth of civilizations or their disintegration? Toynbee has not resolved Spengler's antinomies but sharpened them by an insistence, whatever his denials, on a hint from God, expressed in success, regarding the merit of activity. The two realms of History and Causality, of Time and Space, of Destiny and Morality remain incommensurable. For Spengler, too, had admitted a religious experience but explicitly affirmed its disjunction from history or, in Toynbee's terms, its rejection of mundane success: "My kingdom is not of this world." This is the final word which admits of no gloss and on which each must check the course wherein birth and nature have set him.</p>
<p>A statesman can be deeply religious, and a pious man can die for his country, but they must both know on which side they are really standing; there is no bridge between directional Time and timeless eternity, between the course of history and the existence of a divine world order. This is the final meaning of the moment in Spengler's abrupt language, expressing the full implication of Toynbee's concept of transfiguration.</p>
<p>Toynbee's methodology adds to these inconsistencies. It offers no support for the assumption of an <em>élan vital</em> manifesting itself in progress. It structures all historical appearances into a causality, the essence of which is expressed by temporal and spatial succession. Thus, Toynbee ascribes the decline of the Holy Roman Empire to the gradual displacement of the ruling dynasty from the frontier marshes to the interior provinces, the reduced challenge of which impaired the intensity of the response. This seems to misunderstand what represented at best.</p>
<p>cit., Vol. II, p. 216. It may be interesting to compare Spengler's# Response to the Interaction of Race and Environment</p>
<p>The opportunity presented by the Devil to God for further creative activity reveals the mechanism by which freedom accomplishes itself in the world. The prediction of historical events is impossible because the reaction of the protagonist to the ordeal must remain the unknown quantity.</p>
<p>Freedom cannot be proved syllogistically; however, an inner experience remains inaccessible to the empiricist. Toynbee's actual analysis defines the response exclusively in terms of challenge. This constitutes a restatement of the Environment theory. For, after all, no environmentalist would claim--as Toynbee implies--that climatic or topographical conditions spontaneously produce civilizations in the manner suggested.</p>
<p>Toynbee's syllogism goes like this: A civilization is that which develops from a challenge. A challenge is that from which a civilization develops. This, however, merely shifts the problem of definition from "development" to "challenge." The use of historical necessity as a guide to action raises the question: for what civilization is a challenge proved excessive by a comparison?</p>

<p>The operation can be beaten tenaciously. The challenge is defined in three terms, of which the middle term represents success in adaptation. The Golden Mean exhibits that challenge which evokes the most potently creative act. Yet Toynbee here defines these concepts syllogistically in terms of each other and explains not challenge but the fact of survival. Just as the "pleasure principle" and the "necessary" dictum, challenge-and-response assigns conceptual quantities to past actions.</p>
<p>Challenge-and-Response, to be meaningful as an assertion of purposiveness, would have to examine the personnel in the response, the unique in the reaction to the ordeal. But this is precisely what Toynbee's method does not permit. His empiricism implies that every event can only result from a commensurate causality defined as Challenge, classifiable as a phenomenon subject to well-understood laws. This is illustrated by his survey of the genesis of civilizations, postulated as the consequence of the stimulus of hard countries. It becomes apparent, however, that among Toynbee's twenty-one civilizations, all climates and all geographical conditions are represented. This indicates that it is not the challenge which structures the response, but the response which finds its challenge.</p>
<p>Freedom is not the nice balance of external factors that evoke the most suitable reaction but an inner state that seeks its own stimulus. For what else can account for the decline of the Easter Islanders? They had conquered the sea, not with any margin of safety, and achieved a considerable cultural level. But then the ocean ceased to be traversed, and Easter Island disappeared into an oblivion from which it re-emerged as a colonial dependency in the nineteenth century. Yet what happened? The severity of the sea did not change; the stimulus of the environment did not lessen. But the capacity to experience the ocean as a challenge, the inner state that had utilized the Infinite as a foil, did diminish, and therein lay the doom of Easter Island. Toynbee recognized the purposive element, but the ambiguity of his method resulted in a definition of the operation of necessity. Freedom, however, is not to be found in the apprehension.</p>
<h1 id="vision-of-external-relations">Vision of External Relations</h1>
<p>Work will develop from an engineering into a society of a maximum of alternatives. Freedom depends less on existence than on the recognition of alternatives, not on a set of conditions but on an inward experience.</p>
<p>The assertion of pervasive purposiveness led Toynbee to deny the existence of any organic factor in the development of civilizations. Societies do not represent organisms but the common field of activity of their members, the medium of communication of their constituents. Their growth is accomplished by mimesis, a social drill, through which the Saints act as roads towards increased etherealization. Breakdowns exhibit a failure of self-determination, not an inexorable fatality. Sin constitutes the causality by which the nemesis of creativity accomplishes itself. Yet again, the mere postulation of freedom is not enough. Toynbee rejected the concept of a civilization's soul in its literal sense but defined it as the "image of a counterworld." Empiricism merely issues in its definition. For what else is Jungianist Spengler, after all, who had not used the word "soul" in the mode of visualizing that which remains eternally alien to the physical eye?</p>
<p>If social drill constitutes a generic feature of social life and exhibits relations that require no formal institutions because of their self-evidence, then Toynbee has merely shifted the emphasis from the manifestations of the organic aspect to a description of its operation. How does mimesis differ from the beat of self-implementation by which Spengler's soul actualizes itself?</p>
<p>Toynbee ascribes the breakdown of civilizations to two contradictory factors: the nemesis of creativity and the mechanicalness of mimesis. This raises formidable difficulties in logic. If mimesis results from the inability of the uninspired majority to absorb directly the inspiration of the Saints, then the charm of the leaders cannot reside in their creativity. How will the mass recognize the Saints? Indeed, their appearance is itself an event of "such unimaginable rarity" that a social drill, the efficacy of which may depend on a certain uniformity, can hardly develop from so uncertain a phenomenon.</p>
<p>The breakdown of mimesis, moreover, is a mechanical failure and bears no relation to a deficient self-determination, Toynbee's usual criterion for decline. If the loss of inspiration by the creative minority accounts for society's disintegration and the secession of the internal proletariat, by what standard is that deficiency apprehended? If the uncreative majority possessed a criterion for creativity, it would not require mimesis. If mimesis constitutes the generic feature of social life, Toynbee cannot complain about its direction, and his attempts to describe breakdown in terms of purposiveness fail.</p>
<p>Toynbee maintains that compulsion replaces charm as the social bond in the early stages of breakdown. The philosopher tasked by a king is doomed to frustration, for his efficiency depends on the implied threat of force. Mimesis, to be effective, must, however, rely on this threat. Thus, it appears that Toynbee's breakdown is, after all, inevitable; its fatality entails a logical conclusion. Toynbee specifically considers the reliance on mimesis as dooming the philosopher masked by a king.</p>
<p>The Function of the Feature Which Distinguishes a Civilization from Primitive Societies</p>
<p>Toynbee replaces the theory of the organic nature of civilizations with the assertion that relations can possess no civilizations and that civilizations represent no more than mere relations. His geometric analogy demonstrates the appearance of such a relation but not its existence. The question arises of what constitutes the common field activity of civilizations. If they represent the medium of communication of their component political communities, then the original difficulty reappears in a different form.</p>
<p>Since the constituent societies are themselves merely relations, they manifestly cannot exhibit dynamic fields. If, on the other hand, civilizations represent the totality of their individual members, then the withdrawal-and-return by which Athens, Italy, and England grew in stature and the mimesis of the civilization's creative minority remains to be explained. Toynbee can never escape these difficulties since he leans toward the conception of civilization as the common field of action of the component political communities and must consider these units organic entities.</p>
<p>This has the basis for the assertion that Athens played truant at a certain stage of Hellenic history. This too is implied by the concept of the Schism in the Soul. It can hardly be maintained that each individual of the disintegrating society exhibits all these possible attitudes. The immanence of the organic factor constantly reappears.</p>
<p>Toynbee rejects futurism and archaism. The "inevitable appearance in twenty-one civilizations of identical political organizations at each stage of development indicates a pervasive immanence, not to be evaded by defining life's necessity as sin. The assertion of freedom stands revealed as the mechanization of inexorability. The attempt to impose an empirical method on monumental reality could yield no other results.</p>
<p>Differentiation by growth sets the limits of development as necessarily as Spengler's Destiny. For if each response automatically produces a new challenge, the range of possible reactions tends to become ever narrower and thereby more determined. The concept of society as a relation accentuates man's insignificance.</p>
<p>In social life, man's power to order his affairs on a rational plan is narrowly restricted since a society is not the chattel of one owner but is the common ground of many men's fields of action. For this reason, a precept that is common sense in the economy of the household and practical wisdom in the life of the spirit is a counsel of perfection in social affairs. This illustrates any abstract exaltation of freedom to the contrary.</p>
<h1 id="noted-this-standing-the-true-implications-of-toynbees-philosophy">Noted this standing, the true implications of Toynbee's philosophy</h1>
<p>Freedom is not to be apprehended by way of historical law. Inner experiences remain unspoiled for a pragmatic method. Morality does not reveal itself in maxims of prudent conduct. Yet the biological approach necessarily leads to such conclusions. In such a scheme, survival exhibits the ultimate test of inner fitness. Toynbee's criteria for ethical conduct are based on their practical utility; permanence constitutes his ultimate test for historical endeavor. Immortality, however, is not a datum of history but an inward resolve. The concept of evolution contradicts its attainability. An unfolding of growth and decay has characterized all historical existence. Toynbee's reliance on transitoriness as a revelation of failure defeats itself, for life implies mortality. No stage of development, even in his terms, has lasted. Every civilization declines.</p>
<p>Though the universal state precedes disintegration, realization precedes the universal state, and birth heralds creation. Can temporal succession contain the causality of history? Is life the cause of death, or night of day? Toynbee's causality recognizes no mysteries. It tends to extract assurance of immortality out of phenomena by conjuring a false appearance. Its tool is an assertive syllogism that attempts to read Divine purposes into historical events and submits even God to normative criticism.</p>
<p>History exhibits unchanging laws, its rhythm apparent to the discerning, its morality success. Toynbee's approach to mythology illustrates the claims of a rationality that denies the existence of any reality outside of fiction. Historical treatment and natural science represent qualitatively equivalent modes of apprehending an equally objective reality. Their suitability for the description of phenomena is determined by the quantity of data. Thus, natural science, with the manageability of its calculations, formulates general laws, while the manifold possibilities of everyday existence allow but the presentation of representative types in the form of fiction.</p>
<p>History, as the mean, has as its most applicable style the comparative study. This explains Toynbee's approach to the New Testament and mythology. As representations of objective occurrences, they contain not only analogies but actual maxims derived from real events. Thus, Eden represents a novel of Integration which, through the intervention of the Devil, is changed to the activity of Yang. Therefore, Sabbath proves the nemesis of creativity, when God in the perfection of the world found no further outlet for His activity.</p>
<p>For this reason, Toynbee has to engage in extended argument to prove the essential "fairness" of God's wager with the devil. Love, as the intuitive force of the universe, must be a Divine attribute, for its absence would indicate a deficiency in God. Christianity must be saved because God's nature has to exhibit at least the same constancy as Man's.</p>
<p>Yet what is Toynbee really doing? This is the magic attitude that wills to escape the transitoriness of its existence. Mythology becomes practical ethics, a comprehended essence, the key to eternal happiness. God obeys well-understood laws of "fairness," "constancy," and "love."</p>
<p>What does humanity mean in such a context? Goethe said: "The noblest manifestation of Mankind is shuddering awe." Toynbee, on the other hand, views the world as a machine, capable of manipulation through a technical knowledge of the levers Challenge-and-Response, Withdrawal-and-Return, and Mimesis. Mythology, however, describes an inner state, not an objective condition. It represents man's attempt to apprehend the fatedness of life in that recognition of necessity.</p>
<p>The Essence of Humanity and Existence</p>
<p>It expresses humanity's hope and not its actualization, man's creative essence, not the material conditions of necessity. In a world of determined phenomena distinguished by mortality, man can give expression to his experience of directed living only by keeping before himself certain goals, not dependent on immediate success, as beacons to follow, or aims to attain. Even a skeptic suggests to Don Quixote that perhaps his famous lady Dulcinea del Toboso does not really exist; he is perfectly willing to entertain this proposition. But at the same time, he asserts that her material reality is much less significant than her exercise of spiritual guidance. She serves as the companion of his prowess, as the motive force of his activity, as the soldier whose struggle becomes worthwhile. Just as Dante's Beatrice lights the road in its aspirations in the quest for inward peace. For this reason, poetry--not because of its correspondence to objective reality--is truer than history for it describes that which man in the Golden Age is, the state of a soul, not in the first instance to be derived from the physical world.</p>
<p>And so poetry testifies to fatality overcome, to the goal of our quest, the hope of our fulfillment, the infinite as certainty. The New Testament offers no causal proofs, nor pristine maxims. Its essence is inward tranquility, the humility that does not attempt to define the limits of mortality and is expressed by Piccardo Donati: "In His will is our peace." This, too, constitutes the true substance of freedom. All resides in an inward experience of life as a process of meaning.</p>
<p>The content of existence cannot depend on social engineering or an apprehension of physical immortality. The desires are irrevocable for being committed with a knowledge of transitoriness. Toynbee completely misunderstood the philosophical ideal of Detachment. It does not reject love but affirms that man's rationality allows the self-determination of action out of a conception of the ultimacy of the moral personality, apart from any considerations of personal attachments# Evolutionary Pattern</p>
<p>The evolutionary pattern posits that survival constitutes the only test of inner fitness. The theological basis results in imparting a divine sanction into biological processes and leads to the Calvinistic implication of failure as a sign of sin. At the end of the road stands transfiguration, the recognition of the super-mundane plane of existence, which Toynbee calls "repulsive," as seen in his works "History: Man's Experience of Morality" and "The Sense of Responsibility."</p>
<h1 id="soit-plenty-259">Soit Plenty! - 259</h1>
<p>Melody, the apprehension of the kingdom of God,</p>
<p>Spengler had a vision of the world as experience but felt only the organic element. Toynbee saw in history a machine, yet recognized theoretically the purposive factor. His failure, despite many brilliant empirical analyses, resulted from an attempt to look into the mere manifestations of history for proof of their noumenal significance, from an effort to find a moral sanction in political events instead of within himself. The problem of necessity and freedom remains unresolved. In a way, it has been pointed out along which the two realms can be united. If freedom is not an attribute of external, objective reality, it must result from an inward state that imposes its patterns on phenomena. If morality is not denoted by successful activity, we must find better criteria for ethical conduct. The two realms of freedom and necessity are perhaps reconcilable through our experience of freedom in a, however, determined world. The meaning of history may appear as the emanation of our moral personality.</p>
<h2 id="of-morality">Of Morality</h2>
<p><strong>Introduction:</strong> The problem of freedom and necessity in the uniqueness of events found in the generality of phenomena. Toynbee understood that man craves greater inward certainty than a mere exhortation to do the necessary. Yet, his attempt to derive a sanction for moral action from an empirical analysis of historical events was doomed to fail. What then is the solution to our paradox? What is the import of freedom in a world of determined phenomena? If the meaning of life cannot be derived as an attribute of reality, wherein does it reside?</p>
<p>Over a hundred years before Spengler and Toynbee, in the provincial Prussian town of Königsberg, the problem of the meaning of life--the paradox of our experience of freedom in a world of causal laws--received its profoundest formulation. Kant was faced with the heritage of a philosophy that had reduced freedom and morality either to the technical knowledge of objective necessity or to a mere catalogue of pleasing perceptions. The opposition of Rationalism and Empiricism is analogous to the conflict between Spengler and Toynbee. Spengler's dictum that man's freedom consists of doing the necessary or doing nothing might have been uttered by Spinoza. Toynbee's implication that survival embodies a mode of morality corresponds to Hume's concept of the pleasure induced by utility, of benevolence as an inherent trait, though, of course, giving it a different content, since survival is an indication of utility.</p>
<p>But Kant refused to admit the validity of these assertions. He affirmed that besides the realm of necessity, there exists the realm of possibility, which implies the notion of limit. Since metaphysics can be defined as tracing the boundaries of the knowable, Kant achieved a resolution of our enigma of the antinomy of freedom and necessity in which metaphysical paradoxes are solved though not known by ethical postulates. Kant limited knowledge to make room for belief. He maintained that the mind imposed certain forms on appearances as a condition for its cognitive action. By analyzing these categories that structure all knowledge, he made phenomenal reality the emanation of pure reason. But at the same time, Kant asserted that reality was not exhausted by its appearances, that profounder levels of meaning existed, revealed to man in his aesthetic, theological, and, above all, moral experiences.</p>
<h1 id="transcendental-intuition-of-freedom">Transcendental Intuition of Freedom</h1>
<p>The transcendental intuition of freedom opens vistas of the noumena, the things-in-themselves, which no causal analysis can ever reach. The meaning given to life discloses a personality whose central sanction does not reside in specific attributes such as moderation or self-control but in the disposition of the will. The merit of conduct depends on its conformity to a rule that is not a law but a guide to action. Since nobody, in the ultimate decisions of life, can obtain a technical solution for moral dilemmas, but is forced to infuse his own spirituality into his decisions, Kant's categorical imperative constitutes an affirmation of responsibility.</p>
<p>This finds particular existence in the concept of a universally legislating will, which serves as both subject and lawgiver in a kingdom of ends and allows for a morality of universal applicability. The categorical imperative provides the framework for Kant's philosophy of history. If the transcendental experience of freedom represents the condition for the apprehension of the greater truth at the core of all phenomenal appearances, then its maxims must constitute norms in the political field. Peace in Kant's philosophy of history reflects his conception of peace as the final purpose of all human striving. Here, however, the magnificent symmetry of Kant's thought weakens. If his idea of a Universal History implies that our moral duty for peace enables us to form a conception of its historical attainability, then the inner relationship with the "Critiques of Pure Reason" remains to be examined.</p>
<p>The problem of peace is central to Kant's thought--inevitable peace in the philosophy of Kant. However, problems arise if Kant means that a hidden plan of nature inexorably compels humanity toward harmony with human volition, but as a tool of nature's mechanism. Necessity, as the "Critique of Pure Reason" abundantly demonstrates, is not to be derived from phenomena. The "Critique of Judgment" illustrates that a conception of purposiveness in nature can be formed as the condition for mechanical law. Yet purposiveness does not mean a definition of purposes. Though a demonstration of its impossibility would vitiate the command of the categorical imperative for peace, this does not logically imply the necessity for proving inevitability. Moreover, the possibility of the categorical imperative results from its very conception, not from its relation to empirical reality.</p>
<p>Theory and practice are united in the moral norm derived from a transcendental experience of freedom. Withal, a road has been pointed towards the resolution of our enigma of men's freedom in a world of determined phenomena. The meaning of life has been seen to constitute the emanation of a personality, not an attribute of reality. Morality derives its sanctions from the inward necessity of the universal.</p>
<p>For Kant's implication of inexorability, see Friedrich, "The Philosophy of Kant," p. 153 (Eternal Peace). See Friedrich, op. cit., p. 458 (Essay on Eternal Peace). For a full discussion, see post "Kant's Philosophy of History." See Bernard, "Critique of Judgment," p. 25. Serious answers contain a sanction for moral actions.

<h1 id="jyival">Jyival</h1>
<p>History--in one interpretation of Kant's essay--represents a challenge for the recognition of the ultimacy of# Jyival</p>
<p>The tremendous spirit of scientific discoveries in the early 17th century gave rise to a belief in the feasibility of inquiry into causes. Thus, a new concept of Absoluteness emerged, defined not by its end but by its essence, and moreover discoverable by anyone through the mere application of the mathematical method to metaphysical problems. The pilot of nature was no longer God.</p>
<h2 id="descartes">Descartes</h2>
<p>Descartes was the founder of modern philosophy, setting the stage for later philosophical discussion. In his work "On the Method," he laid down the following rules for abstract speculation:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Rule Number</th>
<th>Rule Description</th>

</table>
<p>His central problem can be defined as an inquiry into the very possibility of knowledge. What relationship exists between objective reality and our ideas about it? There is daily proof of the fallibility of sense impressions, and the possibility exists that some malignant demon might so warp the cognitive faculties that a rational knowledge of reality becomes impossible.</p>
<p>Descartes escapes from this total solipsism by first asserting that, whatever the power of the deceiver, thought implies a thinking substance, and the reality of the "I" who thinks and doubts is assured. Moreover, the intervention of an omnipotent God, who by definition cannot be a deceiver, guarantees the reality of the physical world.</p>
<p>The Cartesian dualism posits two finite existences--thinking and extended--both of objective reality, with the Infinite Substance as the middle ground and the assurance of certainty. Descartes' attempt to attain knowledge through mere methodology raised many difficulties. God's existence was demonstrated by the very faculty that had been seriously brought into question. Moreover, if the Deity guarantees objective reality, <em>Cogito ergo sum</em> becomes a meaningful statement.</p>
<p>Less Dialectic Exercise</p>
<p>The trend of subsequent philosophical discussion was established. Though Descartes' main concern was not moral philosophy, he strongly implied that virtue resulted from the right knowledge of an objective reality.</p>
<p>The Unsatisfactoriness of Cartesian Dualism</p>
<p>This led to two strands of thought, each more consistent than Descartes and each utilizing one of Descartes' substances as the basis of its philosophy: Spinozistic Pantheism and British Empiricism. Spinoza opted for God. He denied that different substances of thought and matter existed. This universe, in all its manifestations, merely reveals God as the unity of all nature and its immanent cause. Matter and mind disclose attributes of the Divine--one viewed under the aspect of extension, the other as thought. In such a scheme, the experience of freedom becomes the emanation of the Deity as the only source of all salvation. Causality in the universe and purposiveness in events never, for Spinoza, serve as an explanatory principle. There are no actions, only happenings. Everything occurs by inward necessity, expressed by conatus, the tendency to persevere in one's own being. Moral sanction attaches to actions that support this effort; no other connotation of good and evil can be conceived. Virtue, as the capacity for self-maintenance, reveals God as the unity of all existence.</p>
<p>The wise man will realize that his advantage can best be served by surrounding himself with an atmosphere of peace, by repaying violence with kindness. An inner reconciliation ensues--a realization that nothing divine deserves contempt, but equally, that sympathy is not required as a source of motivation. Acting with <em>enlightened egoism</em>, the sage masters the passions that testify to his existence in nature and attains the power of self-determination in the bliss of a resignation into God. Virtue is thus attained by knowledge, by understanding the inexorability of events and by the correct evaluation of one's true advantage. The similarity to Spengler (and to Hobbes) is striking, however different their conclusions. Both appreciate that an inevitable necessity rules existence, for which causality constitutes a shallow and inadequate explanation. Both find the key to comprehension in an intuitive grasp of the immanence that produces all occurrences.</p>
<p>Spinoza, just as Spengler, perceives the state as engaged in a fight for sheer survival. Friedrich, in <em>Inevitability of Peace</em>, has characterized Spinoza as the logical philosophy of Calvinism. Spinoza's sole criterion is inward certainty, as seen in the <em>Essay on Human Understanding</em>.</p>
<h2 id="freedom">Freedom</h2>
<p>Freedom is the apprehension of an objective necessity to which man imparts but little. Insight, backed merely by reason, was too great. An era of new scientific discovery, particularly in physics, seemed to demonstrate that the true source of knowledge was not the mind but nature; indeed, that the mind is instructed by nature.</p>
<p>Locke, founding the school of British Empiricists, conceived of the mind as a blank tablet endowed with a wax-like capacity of receiving sensory impressions. Thus, the other implication of Descartes was developed into an assertion of the primacy of the physical substance, leading to a rejection of any innate ideas. Carried to its ultimate conclusion by Hume, this led to total metaphysical skepticism. Knowledge was based on experience.</p>
<h1 id="jience-reasoning-revealed-the-habitual-expectation-of-recurrent-fluctuations">Jience, Reasoning Revealed the Habitual Expectation of Recurrent Fluctuations</h1>
<p>Cause and effect constituted but the representation of a constant conjunction of events, so that the appearance of event A leads to the anticipation of event B. Yet one cannot postulate a necessary connection between A and B. Space and time merely exhibit the results of certain regularities or juxtapositions of empirical entities. Thus, innate ideas were non-existent, and the concept of ultimate reality is meaningless.</p>
<p>Hume's ethics reflect his metaphysical assumptions. Morality was based on a pleasing sensibility, the faculty of benevolence whereby humane impulses receive inward approbation. Social institutions depend in part on habit and in part on the pleasure derived from their utility. Thus, morality became the only source of motivation. The similarity in the conclusions of the empiricists Toynbee and Hume illustrates the effect of metaphysical assumptions. In each case, survival is given moral sanction, conceived as an indication of utility by Hume and as an emanation of Divine grace by Toynbee. But where Hume's metaphysical skepticism shrinks from ascribing ultimate purposes to phenomena, Toynbee's theological convictions enable him to finded the whole truth within themselves and claimed their self-evidence as the objective pattern of reality. Yet the attempt to achieve certainty by an analysis of innate ideas was doomed to failure, despite many great achievements of internal consistency. The rationalists were ever forced to abstract from the uniqueness of experience to achieve a minimal form. The subjective existence of external reality and its relation to innate ideas was insolvable in this formulation. The irony of the rationalist position is best expressed by their ultimate recourse to inner experience and subjective certainty as the final criterion of the validity of their judgments.</p>
<p>Empiricism, on the other hand, faced the dilemma that despite the acuteness of its analyses of ordinary thought, its tenets lacked the universality that forms the foundation of a profound ideology. To base cognition on mere experience is to risk the overthrow of one's concepts with each new experience. Kant was thus faced with the alternatives of freedom as a function of mechanistic naturalism or morality as an open.</p>
<h1 id="a-wentenad-hedonism">A Wentenad Hedonism</h1>
<p>How can reason give effect to the transcendental experience of freedom in a world obeying well-understood laws? What impact can moral maxims have on the unfolding of political events? What is the relation of history to one's experience of morality? Kant decided that the problem was insoluble until the boundaries of the realm of necessity and freedom were defined. Capable of intellectual manipulation, the problem of obedience asserted that a mechanistic description of nature did not preclude a conception of its transcendental immanence, which must be interpreted, however, as a datum of inward experience, not as a category of reason. He limited knowledge to make room for a recognition of life as meaningful alternatives based on an explicit limitation of mere rational analysis. Man can find the sanction for conduct only within himself, not as an attribute of external reality. Kant's metaphysics, expressed in his <em>Critique of Pure Reason</em>, thus serve as the basis for an understanding of his Metaphysical Theory.</p>
<h2 id="kants-central-problem">Kant's Central Problem</h2>
<p>Kant addressed his central problem regarding the implication of the transcendental experience of freedom by re-examining the metaphysical presuppositions of both the rationalists and the empiricists. The rationalists had reduced freedom to a technical mastery of natural relations because their analytic judgments a priori made recourse to experience impossible. The empiricists had approached morality as a problem of analyzing the pleasing perceptions of benevolence or utility because their synthetic judgments a posteriori had denied the possibility of universal validity. Yet experience without concepts remains blind, while concepts without precepts are meaningless.</p>
<p>Kant solved this dilemma by what he termed his <em>Copernican revolution</em>. Perhaps the problem of how to achieve a relationship between ideas and external reality, which had led Descartes and Spinoza to invoke God as the connecting link, and which on the other hand had forced Hume into total skepticism, was so intractable because its basic epistemological assumptions were incorrectly stated.</p>
<p>Just as Copernicus, when he could not account for certain physical phenomena on the assumption that the sun revolved around the earth, was finally forced to reverse this formulation, so Kant restated the dilemma of how the mind, which is abstract as mere, can inform the concrete external reality. He revolutionized metaphysics by insisting that instead of the mind conforming to external reality, physical objects can only be understood if they conform to certain patterns and rules imposed by the mind. He emphasized, however, that reality in its entirety can never be comprehended. Kant's knowledge extends only to phenomena in sensuous experience. Ultimate reality, the things-in-themselves, are not disclosed to the cognitive faculties.</p>
<p>If this is true, then Critical philosophy, by analyzing the essential structure of the thought processes, can attempt a definition of the forms by which external reality is apprehended by pure reason, and synthetic a priori judgment will be possible. These judgments state that all phenomenal experience must conform to certain patterns, for the constitution of the human mind prevents cognition in any other context.</p>
<p>The Distinction of Reality into Phenomenal and Noumenal</p>
<p>The distinction of reality into phenomenal (apprehended by pure reason) and noumenal (things-in-themselves and as such the object of speculative reason) does not mean that knowledge of noumenal reality is impossible. Though pure reason is confined to phenomenal appearances, the noumena may reveal themselves to man by way of inward experience. The realm of freedom appears as the transcendental condition of necessity. Thus Kant limits knowledge to achieve belief, as he establishes the possibility of purposeful morality in a world of determined causality.</p>
<p>The validity of Kant's <em>Critique of Pure Reason</em> depends on his analysis of the framework within which phenomenal experience occurs. Time and space, in this sense, are not empirical realities nor properties of objects but patterns imposed by the mind on nature. Space is an absolute requirement to enable us to refer experiences to objects outside ourselves. The non-existence of space cannot even be imagined, though space without objects to fill it is conceivable. Similarly, substance constitutes a category imposed by the mind to account for the possibility of change, for unless a permanence in some respects is postulated, each modification would involve a new object. Causality reveals the condition that establishes the difference between objective and subjective cognition, between perception and imagination.</p>
<p>When events occur in a certain order, the mind attempts, by an effort of will, to reverse this sequence. If it fails, the objective reality of the experience is assumed, and its fitness for causal analysis is established. Kant thus transcended Hume's skepticism by limiting man's field of knowledge to the world of natural occurrences, forced into patterns by pure reason. He affirmed, however, that the phenomenal world may only represent an inadequate portion of reality, the further reaches of which can never be apprehended by pure reason, but the existence of which speculative reason posits.</p>
<p>The Following Analysis</p>
<p>The following analysis is intended merely to indicate the general trend of Kant's argument. It is not meant to serve as an exhaustive discussion of the categories.</p>
<p>The Critique of Pure Reason</p>
<p>The <em>Critique of Pure Reason</em> ends with a series of antinomies relating to the finite and infinite, to freedom and God versus causality. How can one speak of human freedom in a deterministic causality for every other? Kant resolves this basic dilemma of existence by invoking his earlier distinction between phenomenal and noumenal reality. If the total reality is expressed in the phenomenal world, then indeed human freedom is meaningless and God as a first cause is a logical inconsistency. If, on the other hand, there exists a noumenal reality beyond the phenomenal manifestations, then insofar as man is noumenal (a thing in itself), he may indeed achieve freedom, though as a physical phenomenon he remains subject to phenomenal requirements.</p>
<p>Pure reason can go no further than making room in its metaphysical scheme for the ultimate reality which may reveal itself to man in his theological, aesthetic, and moral experiences. On the other hand, pure reason can show the weakness in the assumptions of both the Rationalists and the Empiricists. If phenomenal reality does not exhaust the totality of man's experiences, freedom cannot be derived from a recognition of naturalistic necessity. If sensuous experience is confined to the appearances of a profounder level of existence, the empirical world cannot contain a moral sanction.</p>
<p>A determined environment is seen to be potentially meaningful after all. The meaning of life becomes the emanation of a personality, not an attribute of the empirical world. Purposiveness is not revealedThe environment is seen to be potentially meaningful after all. Purposiveness is not revealed by phenomenal reality but constitutes the resolve of a soul. Freedom does have a place in a determined universe. The rigorousness and symmetry of Kant's method cannot be overemphasized. No other philosopher had a clearer grasp of the implications of our experiences of freedom in a world of causality. He fully recognized the importance of a profound metaphysics for the apprehension of a total reality, which was not, however, exhausted by the categories of pure reason. Kant's metaphysics, which have traced the boundaries of human knowledge, at the same time opened vistas of an ultimate experience, serving as the condition for the apprehension of a morality that gives the profoundest expression to the intrinsic worth of the moral personality--the transcendental experience that connects man with the Infinite.</p>
<h1 id="moral-philosophy">Moral Philosophy</h1>
<p>"Two things fill the mind with ever new and increasing awe and admiration, the more frequently and continuously reflection is occupied with them: the starry heaven above me and the moral law within me. I ought not to seek either out there in the field of vision as though they were shrouded in obscurity or visionary. I see them confronting me and link them immediately with the consciousness of my existence. The first (the starry heaven) begins with the place I occupy in the external world of sense and expands the connection in which I find myself in the incalculable vastness of worlds upon worlds, systems within systems over endless ages of periodic motion, their beginnings and perpetuations. The second (the moral law) starts from my invisible self, my moral personality, and depicts me in a world of true infinitude which can be sensed only by the intellect. With this, I recognize myself to be in a necessary law and general connection, not just accidentally as appears to be the case with the physical world. Through this recognition, I also see myself linked to all visible worlds. The first view of a numberless quantity of worlds destroys my importance since I am an animal-like being who must return to its matter from whence it came to the planet (a mere speck in the universe). The second view raises my value infinitely as an intelligence through my personality; for in this personality, the moral law reveals a life independent of animality and even of the entire world of sense. This is true, at least as far as one can infer from the purposeful determination of my existence according to this law. This is not restricted to the conditions of life that relate to the infinite."</p>
<p>Kant's ethics derive from the transcendental experience of the moral law, from a vision of the same reality that constitutes the real essence of appearances. Freedom is an inward state that elevates humanity out of the world of necessity into the realm where man, in Dostoevsky's words, "perceives the divine mystery of things." But what is the nature of the moral law? How can any content and universality be ascribed to it in the face of the intensely personal experience of freedom? Is morality expressed by conformity to explicit regulations, or by an inward state that gives meaning to its own?</p>
<h2 id="maxims">Maxims</h2>
<p>As in his <em>Critique of Pure Reason</em>, Kant rejects the views of both the Rationalists and the Empiricists. Objective necessity, naturalistically conceived, cannot constitute the essence of morality, for that would deny the direct experience of free will. Ethical hedonism is inadequate because it prevents the formulation of a universal rule. The happiness postulated by hedonism and the feeling of benevolence of Hume multiply motivations but suffer from the same defects as synthetic a priori judgments. The Epicurean concept of higher (mental) and lower physical pleasures is meaningless in such a context. Intentionality, not order, of enjoyment can serve as the only logical criterion for hedonism.</p>
<p>If neither rationalism nor empiricism provides a foundation, how can humanity give effect to its moral law? Kant finds the answer in the very constitution of man. If everything in nature is created with a maximum of economy and the means chosen most apt, then happiness conceived as desire-satisfaction cannot represent the purpose of a rational being. Instinct would suffice for the achievement of pleasure in the hedonistic sense. But man is endowed with reason and, above all, a practical reason that issues forth into action and seemingly multiplies motivations. The faculty of rationality must consequently be designed to implement the moral experience. But how can a personal experience contain a universal obligation? Just as the metaphysical dilemma was resolved only with the aid of synthetic a priori judgments, so Kant gives effect to man's experience of freedom by a priori principles that determine the will by their own inner necessity. Moral obligation consequently does not attach to such laudable qualities as moderation, self-control, or calm deliberation, for in villains, these very qualities tend to accentuate evil. The merit of conduct is determined solely by the disposition of a will that acts according to a rational principle.</p>
<h2 id="his-teleological-concept">His Teleological Concept</h2>
<p>His teleological concept depends on Kant's <em>Critique of Judgment</em>, which sets out a concept of duty expressed as respect for the moral law. This precludes inclination as a guide to action but equally prevents the definition of morality as a technical knowledge of naturalistic relations. How then is the will determined by reason? In a holy will that acts necessarily according to the moral law, such a determination is unnecessary. The human will, however, torn by desires, requires an imperative, a representation of a ground of action expressed by the word "ought." It is a hypothetical imperative if represented as a means to an end, a categorical imperative if an end in itself. But the moral law stems from a transcendental experience, from a recognition of an ultimate reality beyond phenomenal appearances and can therefore be implemented only by the categorical imperative, the maxims of which assure universality.</p>
<p>Kant's first formulation of the categorical imperative derives from the conception of the moral law determining the will by its own inward necessity from a priori principles. It states, "Act as if the maxims of thy action could become by thy will universal laws of nature." Morality, in this sense, results from a point of view that recognizes that by its actions, it gives maxims of universal applicability. The difference between morality and expediency, between the inward compulsion of duty and inclination, becomes immediately apparent.</p>
<h2 id="the-categorical-imperative-and-moral-law">The Categorical Imperative and Moral Law</h2>
<p>The key to an immoral action resides in the willingness to make an exception in favor of inclination to a moral law recognized as of universal validity. Kant's second formulation relies on the distinction between the categorical imperative as an end in itself and the hypothetical imperative in which the motivation is but a means.</p>
<p><em>"So act, as to treat humanity whether in your own person or in that of others as an end only and never as a means. "</em></p>
<p>This concept expresses the recognition of the ultimacy of man's moral personality, the apprehension of tolerance that sets limits to one's activity out of respect for the divine in humanity. Its goal is the kingdom of ends, in which the autonomy of the wills precludes any personal inclination in the carrying out of moral laws. Here, every man is both legislator of universal maxims and subject to the rules created.</p>
<h2 id="possibility-of-the-categorical-imperative">Possibility of the Categorical Imperative</h2>
<p>How can the categorical imperative furnish a conception of its possibility? If man forms part of nature, he is ruled by causality. This raises a series of other antinomies. Man attempts to achieve morality, yet the goal is distant, and intuitively one feels the impossibility of its attainment. Man longs for the Summum Bonum--happiness--yet no connection exists in the phenomenal world. Duty seems the only means that can guide humanity in its quest for morality.</p>
<p>Kant returns to the distinction in the <em>Critique of Pure Reason</em> between the noumenal and the phenomenal world. Insofar as man participates in the realm of necessity, he is indeed determined. However, morality does not describe an order of nature; it has its origins in a mystic attitude within us. Ethics testify to an experience that raises man above himself, out of the world of senses, into the noumenal reality of the Divine design. Freedom, the possibility of which speculative reason asserted, is now postulated by practical reason.</p>
<p>The striving for perfection induced by the moral law implies immortality to give effect to an endeavor impossible of fulfillment in a finite time. God appears as the guarantor of the Summum Bonum. The postulates of God, freedom, and immortality represent an assertion of the pervasiveness of man's moral experience. The transcendental experience of freedom overcomes all obstacles offered by the empirical realm. Theory and practice are united in the categorical imperative, the possibility of whose implementation derives from its very conception.</p>
<p>For interpretation of this attitude, see the post "The Sense of Responsibility."</p>
<p>N. Xemp. Smith - <em>A Commentary to Kant's Critique of Pure Reason</em>, p. 608</p>
<p>Smith points out that in later life, Kant considered this an overly theoretical proof of God's existence and asserted instead that God speaks directly through the categorical imperative.</p>
<p>Through his moral experience--not through any analysis of empirical reality--man attains a vision of a higher world-order and of the meaning of occurrences. This enables Kant to redefine Christianity on the basis of a transcendental intuition without attempting to claim that the moral law is holy and presupposes a will directly determined by its commands. Yet all man can achieve in this life is a rightful disposition arising out of respect for the law. The yearning for the bliss of holiness, therefore, postulates eternity. The order of nature can offer no happiness as an inducement for the performance of the moral law. However, the Christian concept of the Kingdom of God opens vistas of a profounder plane, in which terrestrial striving dissolves in the blessedness of inward peace.</p>
<p>In the same sense, Kant understands the biblical command of loving God and of loving one's neighbor as oneself. Pathological love cannot be commanded. But a feeling of respect for the experience of the moral law, a liking to do one's duty based on an a priori conception expressed in the categorical imperative, and an approach to man as an end constitute the true meaning of ethical love.</p>
<p>Kant has come full cycle. His <em>Critique of Pure Reason</em>, establishing the limits of knowledge by the distinction between phenomenal and noumenal reality, left room for a significant claim to external reality for his effort. The imperative is possible. The necessity of the categorical imperative must be kept in mind when considering the criticism of Kant's ethics. Kant maintains that the validity of ethics issues from the necessity attending their thought.</p>
<p>Kant's moral philosophy achieves unity; however, the content of the categorical imperative can become so vague as to lose all meaning. He cites the case of a young Frenchman torn between the desire for reasonable German retaliation or staying and losing his self-respect. The transcendental experience of freedom gives meaning to the concept of a will determined to action by a priori considerations. The kingdom of ends emerged and affirmed man's dignity as the goal of ethical activity.</p>
<p>The rationalistic formulation of Kant's ethical philosophy tends to obscure its profound visions. Morality is found to reside in a mystic relationship to a supersensuous world-order, which presupposes the prior experience of the moral law. This ethics, as discussed by Schweitzer and Sartre--though they differ in their points of view--remarkably restate similar arguments. The young Frenchman joins De Gaulle's forces, thereby exposing his mother to risk. Kant's categorical imperative offers no solution to this dilemma according to Sartre. Whatever the ultimate decision, he would treat somebody, either himself or his mother, as merely a means. Despite the imprecision of the example, it illustrates well the confusion involved in this interpretation of Kant's ethics.</p>
<p>Philosophy should be a manual of action, supplying technical solutions to all the problems of existence.</p>
<p>But the dilemmas of life cannot be reconciled by manipulation. Ethical conduct must reveal a personality, not a mastery of causal connections. Kant understood this and based his whole moral philosophy on a transcendental experience. This implies, however, that the categorical imperative can give conditions only to a prior moral experience. Its universality expresses a feeling of responsibility towards humanity; its obligation testifies to a vision of an ultimate reality.</p>
<p>The existentialists are right in their assertion that life involves action. But their demand that philosophy should offer absolute certainty tends to deny the uniqueness of the individual. The experience of freedom in a determined world implies that we can transcend necessity only by imparting our individuality to the inexorable unfolding of events. The existentialists' emphasis on activity, however, reduces man to an atom, affected by fate, doomed to whirl in concentric circles until a stable constellation is achieved through an understanding of causal laws. This confuses a physical state with an ethical ideal imperative. No other person can ever feel the soul's relation to the lover. Philosophy can therefore never create an ethical evidence. The motive force for this activity arises in the moral.</p>
<p>Similarly, Schweitzer wants ethics to be a necessity of thought. This too expresses a quest for certainty in an uncertain world, a claim to wrest out of intellectual constructions an immortality which the experience of directedness denies. A necessity of thought cannot occur in a vacuum; the moral experience reveals a task, not an inevitable development.</p>
<p>The young Frenchman's dilemma, therefore, was an aspect of the fatedness of existence, not a refutation of the categorical imperative in the ultimate crisis of life. Man must solve his problems with dignity, but alone. The categorical imperative can guide an attitude only if preceded by a transcendental experience of freedom. Experiences are personal, and no outer system can constitute a necessity of thought or provide technical solutions for all of life's problems. It is humanity's responsibility to give its own meaning to its own existence, grounded in anrrences which the intellect produces under the conception of freedom. Freedom and ethics thus become a mode of necessity; an immanence rules all happenings, only the apprehension of which differs, but not its operation. This is a profound analysis, though not a necessary one. The causality of the physical world represents a mode of apprehending phenomena, not a property of their occurrence. The experience of freedom constitutes man's intuition of an ultimate reality.</p>
<h1 id="world-order">World Order</h1>
<p>But this does not mean that this transcendence is, in fact, the objective representation of the operation of noumenal reality. On the contrary, if noumenal reality is approachable only by an inward experience, the mode of its operation in the physical world must, of necessity, remain undecided.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the tendency to equate man's experience of the moral law with the objective meaning of occurrences exists in Kant. It comes to expression in his philosophy of history, in which the duty to work for peace appears first as an emanation of the categorical imperative, only to stand revealed as the objective principle governing historical events.</p>
<p>The next section will deal with the problems raised by such a conception and by the attempt to equate history with man's experience of morality.</p>
<p>What validity can be ascribed to a duty that seems alienated by all experience? The practical man will be ready to point out that the moral law rarely coincides with the volition for its performance. Yet empirical reality can never supply a criterion for motivated activity in Kant's scheme. If man denies his transcendental experience of freedom, then indeed public law is meaningless, and eternal peace is a chimera. If, on the other hand, the moral law constitutes man's connecting link with noumenal reality, then the realm of necessity appears as but a manifestation of the realm of freedom.</p>
<p>Opposition can occur between theory and practice. The empiricist, according to Kant, is ever forced to equate empirical reality with morality. The political moralist adapts his maxims to phenomenal appearances and imputes his notion of practical wisdom to the Divine. The moral politician, on the other hand, for whom the categorical imperative represents an absolute norm, realizes that the lawful organization of government implies a coincidence of the moral attitude in all particular wills.</p>
<p>Though the weight of tradition may preclude an immediate modification of institutions, the moral law ever guides the quest, serving as a beacon to follow, an aim to attain. The political moralist knows men, but the moral politician understands man, the dignity of whose personality resides in the only possibility for conceiving a duty, the sole guide to moral action. Thus, politics becomes a task of giving effect to man's duty.</p>
<p>Just as Kant's metaphysical theory had given meaning to the transcendental experience of freedom, so his categorical imperative determines man's political duties.</p>
<p>"Morals, when conceived as the totality of absolutely binding laws, derive their authority from the sense of duty. It is therefore a paradox to say that one cannot talk about what one ought to do once the authoritativeness of this concept of duty is acknowledged."</p>
<p>With this assertion of the absolute pervasiveness of the moral law, the Appendix to Kant's Essay on Eternal Peace begins. No conflict can exist between theory and practice in the political realm any more than in the moral. The categorical imperative applies to all activity in every field, its possibility postulated by its very conception.</p>
<p>But what is the nature of the duty which the categorical imperative commands from a priori considerations? Kant finds that man must always be treated as an end, never as a means. In the domestic field, this implies the creation of a republican constitution, in which the categorical imperative is.</p>
<h1 id="institutionalized-in-a-general-will-in-relations-between-states">Institutionalized in a General Will: In Relations Between States</h1>
<p>This makes the attainment of eternal peace the statesman's noblest aim. Kant (Eternal Peace) Friedrich - the Philosophy of Kant, p. 454. Friedrich - Inevitable Peace p. 53 offers a different interpretation.</p>
<p>For Kant's criteria of a republican constitution, see post.</p>
<p>The categorical imperative emerges as the norm of all political endeavor, lighting the road toward the achievement of a republican constitution and the attainment of eternal peace. The meaning of history results from an inward apprehension that determines the way any regard to its immediate empirical attainability. Peace represents the goal of all human striving, the fulfillment of the purpose of history.</p>
<p>Kant's Essay on Eternal Peace comprises nine articles for a hypothetical treaty among nations for the assurance of universal peace. The first six, the preliminary articles, are frankly remedial, directed at specific abuses in contemporary diplomacy. Though addressed to technical problems, their obligation derives in each case from the a priori conception of the moral law. They are:</p>

</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>The preliminary articles express Kant's conception of the determination of the will by the categorical imperative on the basis of a priori considerations. The task of achieving peace derives from the transcendental experience of the moral law, not from any accidental constellation of empirical facts. If the categorical imperative commands the achievement of eternal peace, any mental reservations that leave open the possibility of future conflicts constitute a violation of the moral law, for which expediency offers no excuse. If the moral sanction of the state resides in its conception of man as an end--expressed in a General Will--then no technical reason exists for treating it as the possession of the ruler. This reduces the state from a moral person to a thing and violates the categorical imperative.</p>
<p>If the moral law commands the treatment of men as an end, consideration of utility can legalize standing armies. Professional soldiers become mere tools, whose very existence creates a constant state of insecurity. No violations of the categorical imperative by other states can serve as an excuse for war. The very existence of oppression should serve as a stimulus to others to implement the categorical imperatives. To work for peace represents mankind's noblest duty.</p>
<p>The pervasiveness of the moral law in Kant's philosophy of history now becomes apparent. Conformity to the categorical imperative contains the moral sanction of the political world. In this sense, the formulation of diplomatic documents, the maintenance of armies, the utilization of economic means for foreign policy, and the employment of force all reveal violations of the moral law, of which even the command for eternal peace presents but a particular instance. Man's experience of free action in a determined world issues into ethical activity and furnishes humanity's guide on the journey through history.</p>
<p>But Kant realized that the application of the categorical imperatives to specific abuses could not provide the ultimate foundation of eternal peace. Kant's three definitive articles of eternal peace embody his conception of the absolute basis for peace, his recognition that peace implies more than the absence of war, and his affirmation of the supremacy of the moral law in the political realm.</p>
<p>Kant argues that a true state of peace results, at least in part, from lawful institutions within nations. If the state of peace is a moral law, it can be given effect only by a moral personality. But how can...e dictates of the categorical imperative operate in social institutions? Just as the moral law contains the objective principle of all actions, so the republican constitution represents the norm of political institutions.</p>
<p>What, however, is a republican constitution? Kant applies three criteria:</p>
<p>| Criteria                                                     |<br />
|-------------------------------------------------------------| | The principle of the freedom of all members of the society as men; |<br />
| --- | --- | --- |<br />
| The principle of equality for all as citizens.</p>
<p>The republican constitution thus institutionalizes Kant's categorical imperative. The assertion of man as intrinsically valuable expresses the transcendental experience of freedom, and the principle of dependence upon common legislation reveals the Kingdom of Ends, in which each individual is both subject and legislator. This testifies to the moral attitude, to a feeling of responsibility towards the rights of others, and to a motivation that derives from a conception of the common good. History is not merely a task but contains a guarantee for the realization of the moral law. This aspect of Kant's philosophy parallels Toynbee's dilemma: the attempt to wrest certainty from the fatedness of life, and the endeavor to conjure phenomena to escape the transitoriness of existence. The subsequent section on the amalgamation of Kant's <em>Idea for a Universal History</em> and his <em>Guarantee for Eternal Peace</em> sharpens the former's implications and forms the core of the analysis.</p>
<p>Kant poses three possible modes for the apprehension of historical events:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Mode</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>1</td>
<td>History can be conceived as the unfolding of a plan (either natural or divine depending on the point of view) to develop humanity from the lowest state of animality to the highest level of human freedom.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2</td>
<td>On the other hand, the succession of political events may reveal no more than the accidental constellation of power relations, which may one day achieve a formation that ensures stability.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>3</td>
<td>Lastly, one can deny any pattern in history, leaving merely a senseless alternation of strife and truce, a constant rise and decline of empires, and a hopeless resignation that cannot attain peace.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Kant argues for the first alternative. If phenomena require for their cognition the formulation of synthetic a priori judgments, and if the moral law derives its validity from a priori considerations of universality, then history can be conceived only on the basis of an a priori principle that reveals its immanence. This principle operates outside the range of human volition and structures the apprehension of events by its own inward necessity.</p>
<p>But how is one to conceive such a philosophy of history? How does one reconcile man's experience of purposiveness with the meaning of occurrences? Kant utilizes the argument from his <em>Critique of Judgment</em> that a teleological principle must inhere in nature as a condition for the regularity of phenomena; only thus can the meaning of history emerge out of the otherwise senseless recurrence of seemingly accidental events.</p>
<h2 id="resdom-and-purposeness">Resdom and Purposeness</h2>
<p>Resdom appears as an aspect of a pervasive mechanism: purposeness. Just as the population statistics of major countries reveal a regularity according to stable natural laws, despite the accidents of individual fortunes, so history, considered as a totality, may contain a pattern apart from the incidental purposes of human beings. Mankind thus promotes an end unknown to them which they would care little for if they knew. But what is this end? What is the a priori principle by which historical events become intelligible? Kant maintains that history's purpose is the achievement of peace through law, by states with republican constitutions. This is, however, neither derived from a transcendental experience nor from the universal obligation of a moral law, but issues from an analysis of the end which the mechanism of nature promotes. Peace becomes a technical task of reconciling empirical conditions with the purpose of existence. The meaning of history is identical with man's aspirations; indeed, humanity's norms constitute but a means for the achievement of an immanent aim.</p>
<h2 id="kants-principles-for-the-apprehension-of-history">Kant's Principles for the Apprehension of History</h2>
<p>Kant lays down nine principles for the apprehension of history. Since history is conceived as subject to a teleology that structures its phenomena a priori, the natural faculties of all creatures must be destined to unfold completely according to their end. Thus, purpose replaces accident, and the rational creature develops his reason. However, the growth in wisdom requires many trials and much experience.</p>

</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>The problem of the establishment of a perfect civil constitution is that it is possible to look upon the history of the human species only as the state in which nature can develop all aptitudes of mankind.</p>
<p>According to a plan of nature that aims at the perfect civil association of the human species, it must be considered possible not to be attained in a single life. Consequently, man's faculties develop completely in the species, not in the individual. However, existence involves strife; life presents a continuous series of problems. Hardship seems the lot of humanity.</p>
<h2 id="mans-faculties-develop-through-the-antagonism-of-society-and-the-struggle-between-nations">Man's Faculties Develop Through the Antagonism of Society and the Struggle Between Nations</h2>
<p>The pressure of competition and the insecurity of the state of nature lead to the formation of civil society, whose invocation of the principle of law testifies to its apprehension, though not immediate attainment, of moral ideals. Man's quarrelsome instincts reveal nature's mechanism for the optimum development of his skills.</p>
<p>Man wants concord, but nature knows better what is good for his kind; nature wants discord. Man wants to live comfortably and pleasurably, but nature intends that he should raise himself out of lethargy and inactive contentment into work and trouble, and then find means of extricating himself adroitly from the latter.</p>
<p>If Society Arises in Response to the Insecurity of Constant Strife</p>
<p>The organization of the proper constitution must represent mankind's most difficult task. Man can develop his natural faculties to the fullest only under a just civil constitution. Kant considers the reconciliation of freedom with the monopoly of force humanity's central political problem. The tendency to make exceptions in one's own favor ever fights against the assertion of the supremacy of law. Law suffers from the fact that it is a product of man and at the same time conceived as embodying objective principles of justice.</p>
<p>The Perfect Civic Constitution, Moreover, Presupposes Lawful Relations Among States</p>
<p>There is no use in working for domestic peace if war constantly threatens from across the borders. The ceaseless preparation for conflict, the feeling of insecurity engendered by armies, and the ravages of never-ending strife all teach humanity what reason alone would have indicated without all this suffering. Just as the experience of the state of nature among individuals led to the formation of civil society, so the eternal tensions between states reveal nature's mechanism for the attainment of peace.</p>
<p>The eventual creation of a just civil constitution, which will forever banish war and usher in an era of harmony among mankind, therefore constitutes the purpose of history. The unfolding of events will force the emergence of this constitution, even if moral precepts fail.</p>
<h2 id="a-philosophy-of-history-based-on-these-assumptions-must-be-possible-according-to-kant">A Philosophy of History Based on These Assumptions Must Be Possible, According to Kant</h2>
<p>A task bequeathed to succeeding generations.</p>
<h1 id="2-generations">2 Generations</h1>
<p>Schweitzer's criticism is thus validated by Kant's "Idea of Nature." History, regarded as a phenomenon, discloses the same relevance that the transcendental experience of freedom postulated. The confusion of the ethical and the natural is complete. It makes little difference whether morality claims the sanction of reality or vice versa; in this scheme, both are reduced to a parallel appearance of the same inexorability. The aspirations of humanity represent but a mode of nature's mechanism.</p>
<p>The sublimity of Kant's moral philosophy derives from his intuition that ethics depended on a direct relation to the infinite--a transcendental experience that sets its own conditions. The distinction between noumena and phenomena represented the resolve of a soul that wanted to escape the determined inevitability of the physical world and impart its own purposiveness to the causal unfolding of events. # An Evaluation of Existing Relations</p>
<p>In the Metaphysics of Morals, Kant states: "It is our duty to act according to the idea of such an end which reason commands (namely peace) even if there is not the least probability that it can be achieved, provided its impossibility cannot be demonstrated." This represents Friedrich's view, who considers Kant's qualifying clause a fundamental condition of his moral philosophy and an important connecting link between the realm of freedom and the realm of necessity.</p>
<p>"No one was more clearly aware of the necessity of testing hypothetical judgment by experience than Kant. No work of Kant's shows this more conclusively than <em>Eternal Peace</em>. In the Appendix, he insisted (as he had often done before) that only what is possible can be morally required, and he recites the dictum of the law: <em>ultra posse nemo obligatur</em>. This is precisely the reason for demonstrating the possibility that in peace-making, as in other human affairs, we learn by doing."</p>
<p>This fact and norm reveal the course of history and man's aspirations. However, this solution is not completely satisfactory. Its validity depends on what Kant meant by proof for impossibility. Friedrich implies that the applicability of Kant's moral principles depends on their attainability in the empirical realm. Yet, the whole tendency of Kant's argument denies this. For Kant did not insist on a proof of the feasibility of the moral law; this would indeed make the empirical world the determining principle of the categorical imperative. On the contrary, he affirmed the obligation of the categorical imperative even if there is not the slightest probability of its being achieved.</p>
<p>But how can a law be binding in the face of all probability and still not be obligatory if its impossibility is demonstrated? The apparent contradiction is resolved if we consider that Kant was quite aware of the fact that an absolute proof of impossibility is out of the question. For what methodology could such an effort utilize? If the particular constellation of political circumstances does not suffice to negate the duty to work for eternal peace, if the reconciliation of all conflict is commanded against "all probability" (and probability implies uncertainty), then no proof for the impossibility of moral maxims is conceivable. Only an infinite mind, encompassing all possible conditions, could make this demonstration.</p>
<p>But God speaks to man through a priori considerations and by its own inward necessity. It expresses man's experience of that ultimate reality which lies beyond mere phenomenal manifestations. The transcendental import of that moral experience recognizes no limits. Wherever its maxims seem to be in conflict with the empirical world, Kant postulates entities that override all considerations of phenomenal reality. God, freedom, and immortality reveal the strength of an intuition that has perceived a higher world order and will not let itself be denied by the constructions of pure reason. To be sure, Kant often discusses the question of the "possibility" of his moral maxims, but this feasibility does not depend on the evaluation of phenomenal reality. On the contrary, Kant repeatedly asserts that the possibility of the categorical imperative is given in its very conception, for if the experience of the moral law elevates man out of the phenomenal world, it shows him a vision of the infinite.</p>
<p>Though it may well be that a methodology that disproves impossibility affirms possibility, a psychological difference exists nevertheless. A strict proof of impossibility in the empirical world, particularly in the political realm, seems out of the question since it would involve a grasp of all possible conditions. In the case of logical constructions, such as mathematics, in which all conditions are previously defined, the situation is different. A demonstration of possibility, on the other hand, involves only the evaluation of a particular set of circumstances. This is essentially the procedure of the scientist who affirms first the possibility and then, through an assumption of uniformity, gives it universality. But Kant specifically required a proof of impossibility.</p>
<p>This is based on Kant's later writings. Friedrich draws the inference from Kant's philosophy that we learn by experience. This undoubtedly exhibits the implications of the Idea for a Universal History and the Guarantee for Eternal Peace. However, it merely restates the dilemma of how to reconcile man's experience of freedom with an immanent necessity. For what exactly does man learn by experience? It cannot be the formulation of the categorical imperative.</p>
<p>Two quotations will illustrate this point. The first is from <em>Theory and Practice</em>:</p>
<p>"There exists a concept which may be expressed by the words constitutional law. If this concept has binding force, it has objective practical reality without our considering what good or ill may result; for the knowledge of these results is based purely on experience. If this be so, then constitutional law is based upon principles <em>a priori</em>, since what is right cannot be taught by experience. A theory of constitutional law exists with which practice must agree in order to be valid."</p>
<p>The second quotation is from the <em>Critique of Practical Reason</em>:</p>
<p>"The second view (the moral experience) raises my value infinitely, as an intelligence, through my personality; for in this personality, the moral law reveals a life independent of animality and even of the entire world of sense... this is not restricted to the conditions and limits of this life but radiates into the infinite."</p>
<p>That derives from <em>a priori</em> considerations. If he learns the technical implementation of the moral law, then indeed experience is useful, though only as a counsel of prudence and not as a test of the validity of judgments. Historical necessity can never supply a guarantee for the actualizing of a command derived from a particular experience. Even granting that the demonstrations for 'not impossible' and 'possible' are identical, they can never be made to imply 'inevitable'.</p>
<p>Kant has expressed the nature of the obligation of the moral law as a guide to the meaning of history, as a norm which validates all striving:</p>
<p>"In order to harmonize practical philosophy within itself, it is necessary first to decide the question whether in tasks of practical reason we should start from the material (i.e., substantive) principle, from its end, or from its formal end.... which states: Act in such a way that you could want your maxim to become a general law (whatever its purpose might be). Without a doubt, the latter principle must take precedence; for as a principle of right, it possesses absolute necessity, whereas the material principle is compelling only on condition that the empirical conditions for its realization exist.</p>
<p>The first principle (which conceives peace as a material end), that of the political moralist, is a mere technical task; the second, which is the principle of the moral politician as an ethical task, is now decided not merely as a physical good, but as a condition resulting from the recognition of duty. Much knowledge of nature is required for the solution of the first problem of political prudence, in order to utilize its mechanism for this purpose, and yet, as far as the result of eternal peace is concerned...</p>
<p>By contrast, the solution of the second problem of political wisdom readily presents itself, is evident to everyone, confounds all artifice, and leads directly to the end..."</p>
<p>The incommensurability of Kant's critical philosophy and his teleological philosophy of history cannot be overcome by considering the latter a demonstration for the possibility of the moral law. It may be argued, however, that Kant's Idea for Universal History merely reveals another aspect of a methodical approach which attempts to attain knowledge by means of a priori principles.</p>
<p>But again, the similarity is misleading. The categories represent forms that explain the process of cognition. The categorical imperative derives from a transcendental experience of freedom and reconciles a personal experience with universal applicability. The content of both the categories and the categorical imperative depends, however, upon subsequent experience.</p>
<p>These quotations are presented at such length because the difference is one of interpretation, which can only be resolved by a reading of the text, not by disproving one interpretation by another.</p>
<p>The conception of a definite purpose in the unfolding of events goes beyond these limits. It does not reveal a method for apprehending phenomena but prescribes their essence. Instead of obtaining its sanction from a direct relationship to noumenal reality, it attempts to claim the sanction of aspirations. Peace or a civic constitution is therefore not analogous as an a priori principle to either the categories or the moral law. The categories are truly a priori in that they merely provide the structure for subsequent experience. The categorical imperative is beyond dispute as soon as one admits man's transcendental experiences of morality. However, peace or civic constitution (which implies lawful external relations) constitutes the instantiation of a general principle, not a necessary mode of historical apprehension. As a specific purpose (since it does not represent a truly a priori principle), it can be refuted by any other postulation of hypothetical goals.</p>
<p>What, then, is this general principle?</p>
<h2 id="kants-critique-of-judgment">Kant's Critique of Judgment</h2>
<p>Kant addresses the problem of a teleological conception of phenomenal reality. He argues that the regularity exhibited by phenomena implies a design in nature. Just as the appearance of a hexagon on a deserted island could not be explained by an accidental constellation of events but would involve a principle of purposiveness, so man can postulate a teleology in the unfolding of phenomena. This teleology provides the condition for the regularity of appearances and makes intelligible the consistency of natural laws. However, a general principle of purposiveness does not necessarily imply knowledge of specific purposes. Kant admits this and draws a sharp distinction between determinative and reflective purposiveness, between derivative and constitutive design. Determinative purposiveness describes the class of rationality that attempts to impose its aspirations as a pattern of objective reality. Constitutive design invokes its principles as the objective immanence of phenomenal occurrences.</p>
<h2 id="how-the-principle-that-makes-causal-knowledge-possible-appears">How the Principle That Makes Causal Knowledge Possible Appears</h2>
<p>Kant calls attention to the fact that a mechanistic conception of the universe cannot suffice for its understanding and that reason must add a teleology, not indeed known by the methods of the first two Critiques, but nonetheless certain.</p>
<p>**F l, Bernard - Critique of Judgment, p. 258. **</p>
<p>**32 Bernard - op. p. 259 et seq.</p>
<h2 id="final-purpose-of-the-universe">Final Purpose of the Universe</h2>
<p>Judgment limits itself to ascribing an intrinsic purposiveness, the embodiment of which in specific purposes remains a mystery. Causality explains the incidental appearances; teleology explains the underlying unity of organic growth.</p>
<p>The consistency of Kant's philosophy begins with intrinsic purposiveness. Since man, he argues, is the only creature capable of forming an idea of teleology, he is also the one who can understand it.</p>
<p>The following quotation illustrates Kant's distinction between purposiveness and purposes, between intrinsic and extrinsic teleology.</p>
<p><strong>Bernard - op. p. 372.</strong></p>
<p>"We can see that external purposiveness can be regarded as an external natural purpose only under the condition that the existence of that being to which it is immediately or distantly advantageous is in itself a purpose of nature. Since that can never be completely determined by a mere contemplation of nature, it follows that relative purposiveness, although it hypothetically gives indications of natural purposes, yet justifies an absolute teleological judgment. Snow in cold countries protects the crops from the frost; it makes human intercourse easier by means of sleighs. Here is a wonderful concurrence of many references of nature to one purpose... But then we do not see why generally men must live there at all. Therefore, to say that vapor falls out of the atmosphere in the form of snow, that the sea has its currents which float down the mud which has grown in warmer lands, and that there are in it great sea monsters filled with oil, 'because (author's italics) the idea of advantage for certain poor creatures is fundamental for the cause which collects all these natural products' would be a very venturesome and arbitrary judgment."</p>
<p>It is interesting to note that despite this refutation, Kant uses almost exactly the same argument in his Guarantee for Eternal Peace (see Friedrich op. p. 449 et seq.). Note the similarity to Spengler's morphology.</p>
<p>**Bernard op. p. 361 et seq.</p>
<h2 id="experience-for-an-objective-principle-of-reality">Experience for an Objective Principle of Reality</h2>
<p>To be sure, men can form a conception of purposes, but Kant himself has derived the recognition of this supersensuous world-order from the experience of freedom; content cannot be claimed as the objective mode of operation.</p>
<p>The manner in which noumena operate in the physical world must therefore remain undetected. If men's purposes are equated with nature's purposiveness, the ethical and the natural become identical, and freedom emerges as but a mode of causality. Every event is both an effect and an inward experience. As an effect, it is subject to causal analysis and to a teleological judgment that postulates an intrinsic purposiveness. As an experience, it reveals man's personality and constitutes the means for transcending the necessity of the phenomenal world. The experience of freedom requires man to give his own meaning to his particular existence. If a transcendental vision guides the quest for the purpose of existence, phenomena can offer no further guarantee, and the empirical world presents no permanent obstacles. If man's essence consists of the ability to act purposefully out of a conception of duty, then empirical reality furnishes at best a challenge, never a condition. The sublimity of the moral law--the wonder which Kant felt at its operation within him--involves a task for which we cannot wrest an assurance of success out of the unfolding of events.</p>
<p>This does not imply that history works against men's aspirations, but simply that we cannot derive our norms by claiming them as history's patterns. The invocation of the mechanism of nature as a sanction for a specific purpose destroys this apprehension. Now, the meaning of history results from an evaluation of specific conditions which, in the absence of a transcendental guiding principle, can be overthrown by any alternative hypothesis. The meaning of existence and the purpose of occurrences cannot be# Journey Through History</p>
<p>The numina that produce appearances are perceived through personal experience, and this accounts for man's essential loneliness in the face of the fatedness of existence. However, it also makes possible the concept of the dignity of the individual, whose will gives universal maxims despite his insignificance as but a speck in a determined system.</p>
<p>Peace testifies to this vision, to the norms which man gives himself as beacons to follow, and to the meaning which humanity may derive from the inexorability of events. The categorical imperative makes possible the reconciliation of all conflicts and the eternal peace that accords with man conceived as an end. Kant had a tremendous intuition of the world as design and phenomena. In an imposing edifice, consistent in its scope, he combined a profound metaphysics with a moral philosophy that reconciles personal experience with universal applicability.</p>
<h2 id="ability">Ability</h2>
<p>He limited knowledge to achieve belief. The rigorous examination of knowable reality enabled an experience that elevated man out of the determined universe of phenomena and brought him into a direct relation with a supersensuous world-order. History reveals a task for achieving the eternal peace commanded by the moral law. No conflict can exist between theory and practice, for the possibility of the categorical imperative is given in its very conception. The meaning of history is identical with man's duty.</p>
<h2 id="kants-attempt">Kant's Attempt</h2>
<p>Kant's attempt to expand the philosophy of history into a guarantee for the attainability of the moral law failed for the same reason as Toynbee's. The realm of freedom and necessity cannot be reconciled except by an inward experience. The mechanism of nature offers no obvious assurance for the implementation of freedom. The identification of the ethical with the natural makes the meaning of history the emanation of will only insofar as this volition is conceived as the tool of organic necessity. Nevertheless, Kant's philosophy has pointed the way to an attempted solution to these problems: the resolution of the riddle of the experience of freedom and our knowledge of necessity. The meaning of life appears as the emanation of a transcendental experience to which the mechanism of nature can offer only a challenge. The pervasiveness of this experience provides its own maxims and overcomes necessity by imparting to it a purposive striving after norms.</p>
<p>Two more problems remain. If the categorical imperative universalizes a transcendental experience, what is the nature of this mystic relationship to the Infinite? If resignation regarding the purposes of the Universe provides the condition for ethical activity, what connection exists between our norms and facts, between the experience of freedom and the unfolding of events? What is the meaning of history in a cosmology based on a direct intuition of a supersensuous world-order, the maxims of which are conceived as having absolute validity?</p>
<h2 id="history-viewed-in-retrospect">History Viewed in Retrospect</h2>
<p>History viewed in retrospect evokes a dual feeling of inevitability coupled with inward doubt. The inevitability results from a contemplation of completed actions, from an apprehension of the facts of occurrence, and from the unfolding of events. The doubt is a token of rebellion against this view, an assertion of the specificity of the individual, and a demand by the soul for its freedom. Whatever one's conception about the necessity of events, at the moment of their performance, their inevitability stands.</p>
<h2 id="guidance-in-action">Guidance in Action</h2>
<p>Spengler believed that he could force the past to yield him maxims of effective conduct. His analysis failed as a postulate of action, however, because necessity constitutes an attribute of external reality. It describes the past, but man lives for the future. The causality that motivates man is an experience of freedom.</p>
<p>Toynbee understood the purposive element, but he demanded a guarantee of its attainability. He sought to wrest from historical events an assurance of permanence, a pledge of physical salvation. However, life does not exhibit this certainty. Phenomena always appear inevitable. At the moment of perception, they already form part of the past. Purposes, on the other hand, describe the immanence of a soul, the visions that man imparts to his determined surroundings, the hopes that condition activity, and the dreams that make life possible. The meaning of life is an inward state.</p>
<p>Kant grasped this. He derived his ethics from a transcendental experience, from a vision of an ultimate reality. The categorical imperative testifies to a vision that lifts man above the sensuous reality and attaches him to a higher world order. A mystic relationship to the Infinite provides the foundation for motivated activity, to which the phenomenal world can offer no permanent obstacles.</p>
<p>To be sure, Kant's Idea for a Universal History tends to demand of the realm of necessity the gift of the realm of freedom. However, this inconsistency is submerged in the transcendental experience of the moral law, which alone suffices to validate all historical striving.</p>
<p>What is the nature of this experience? It does not derive from the phenomenal world, for this knows only necessity. It is not produced by rational reflection, for it provides the condition for the determination of the will by reason. It must constitute a mystic attitude, then--an inward state that feels the cosmic in the Universe. There are moments in every person's life when the tensions fall away, and the unity of all creation appears as a sudden vision. These are the occasions when time stands still, and man partakes of eternity.</p>
<p>This is Spinoza's intellectual love of God, the total apprehension of the divine immanence, the resignation that gives peace, and the bliss that elevates man above himself. This is why the Greeks considered the good and the beautiful as a unity: the good as a testimony to the Divine in action; the beautiful as an intuition of the Ultimate in contemplation.</p>
<p>Man's freedom, then, is the recognition of necessity, which enables him to transcend the determined inevitability of his environment. But how can a recognition of necessity multiply freedom? If this is true, why not multiply restrictive measures to increase liberty?</p>
<p>These objections mistake the objective necessity of the phenomenal world for the inward necessity of a recognition of limits. The sanction that we give to the necessity felt as a reality transcending our existence, and the meaning ascribed to our particular life (which, like any fact, also has limits), testify to a personality and to the unique contribution each man imparts to the inevitable. This is ethical freedom, which reveals the reverence of a soul and exhibits a realization that one is man and not God.</p>
<p>From the feeling of reverence stems tolerance, respect for the dignity of the individual, and the apprehensions that set boundaries to one's endeavors.</p>
<p>Schweitzer believed that the will to live provided the basis for this inward liberation. However, he was mistaken. The will to live merely wishes to prevail. At best, as in Hobbes, it may derive maxims of prudence for self-preservation.</p>
<h2 id="ethical-activity">Ethical Activity</h2>
<p>Ethical activity does not derive its maxims from the struggle for survival. It reveals an inward state that conditions the self-assertiveness of the will through the recognition of a higher reality that contains the sanction of all endeavor. Life is suffering; birth involves death. Transitoriness is the fate of existence. No civilization has yet been permanent.</p>
<p>The Fatedness of History</p>
<p>The fatedness of history presents the dilemma of mortality. Spengler's assertion that the appearances of life exhaust its meaning denies the transcendental fact of existence. We know we must die and yet live content to review experiences that are incommensurable with intentions, of successes that were not willed, and failures that seem undeserved. The necessity of setting limits to one's actions is paramount. The feeling of reverence, which does not claim its hopes as a pattern of reality, becomes the foundation of morality. This is not a necessity of thought but a condition of experience, not the utilization of nature's mechanism but the means for its transcendence.</p>
<h2 id="relation-of-history-to-morality">Relation of History to Morality</h2>
<p>This gives us a clue to the relation of history to man's experience of morality. What is the meaning of the transitoriness of historical existence in the face of man's possibility of self-transcendence? If moral action derived its maxims from phenomenal reality, one would expect that history should disclose some increase in mastery over the human problems of existence. If virtue were merely the necessity, the right knowledge of an objective, naturalistic necessity, the past should disclose some progress towards a definition of universally recognized ethics. Above all, if the cause of nature parallels man's aspirations, then all the hopes of the past become but a cruel joke and history a tale told by a madman.</p>
<p>The Significance of the Sybil</p>
<p>The significance of the Sybil becomes meaningful, as she is the "old seeress who sits in her cave and writes her oracles on leaves which the wind scatters." Men depart without counsel and hate the Sybil's dwelling. However, man's freedom does not reside in a manipulatory knowledge of external reality. Morality does not derive from an apprehension of objective necessity to be mastered as a technical problem. If, on the other hand, man's existence constitutes a mystical relationship to the Infinite, it becomes each individual's responsibility to infuse their specificity into the inevitability of phenomena, and an absolute guide to action appears impossible. If morality reveals a transcendental experience, no necessary connection exists between phenomenal reality and man's freedom. The significance of ethical conduct depends on this distinction being maintained; otherwise, the ethical and the natural are equated, and freedom and causality appear.</p>
<h1 id="freedom-and-necessity-reconciled-a-clue-from-poetry">Freedom and Necessity Reconciled - A Clue from Poetry</h1>
<p>Since an experience is always unique and solitary, its simultaneous appearance in others cannot be postulated. For this reason, history offers no guarantees for the achievement of moral norms. This does not mean that the unfolding of events necessarily frustrates man. Such an assertion would also make the physical world the source of moral maxims, for the framework of every object. This is the token of the account from those whose obsession with the dangers of materiality absorbed their energies in a negation of carnal pleasure and led to the invocation of predestination as God's sanction to the elect, revealed by temporal success. The transcendental experience of the moral law, on the other hand, leaves the question of purposes in history undecided. Its freedom is an inward state that has come to the recognition of its limits and, with that realization, overcomes the torments of phenomena by infusing them with its spirituality.</p>
<p>Dante expressed this conception on the pilgrims' journey towards inward peace:</p>
<p>"'Master,' I said to him, now tell me also: 'this fortune, of which thou hintest to me, what is she that has the good things of the world thus within her clutches?"</p>
<p>"And he to me: 0 foolish creatures, how great is this ignorance that falls upon you! Now I wish thee to receive my judgment of her. He whose wisdom is transcendent over all made the heavens and gave them guides so that every part shines on every other part, equally distributing the light; in like manner, for worldly goods he ordained a general minister and guide to change betimes the vain possession from people to people."</p>
<p>Hence, one people commands, another languishes obeying her sentence, which is hidden like the serpent in the grass.</p>
<p>"Your knowledge cannot understand her: she provides, her permutations have no truce; necessity makes her be swift. This is she who is so much reviled, even by those who ought to praise her, when blaming her wrongfully and with evil words. But she is in bliss and hears it not..."</p>
<p>Phenomenal reality can offer no motive force for moral action. Resignation to the purposes of the universe provides the foundations of a meaningful ethics.</p>
<p>Aristotle stated that poetry is truer than history. He meant that man's hopes reveal his essence more clearly than their incidental embodiment in historical fact. Poetry testifies existence, to the uniqueness that each man imparts to his determinations.</p>

<p>In Nature's Mechanism</p>
<p>In Homer and Dante, the mystery of growth is still noticeable. The enchantment with beauty and the fresh exultation at creativity come to expression. Homer and Dante live within nature; the glistening of the sun on leaves and the beating of the waves on rocks is not yet so familiar as to be commonplace, nor so remote as to offer a vision of a peace which the turbulence of the soul denies. The world still appears as a possibility through a reconciliation of the will with necessity, in Homer blindly striving, in Dante blissfully certain.</p>
<h1 id="virgil-and-milton">Virgil and Milton</h1>
<p>Virgil and Milton, on the other hand, are both full of inward doubts. They are both Protestant in that their own standards frequently clash with the viciousness of history. The mystery of life has been dissipated, and only the struggles remain. The concern with materiality ensues, not to be denied by Virgil's description of Dis or Milton's evocation of Pandemonium.</p>
<p>For Homer, necessity was unapproachable, and Dante's Fortune served only as the distributor of meaningless possessions. However, Virgil views wealth as itself evil, and Milton's Adam falls because carnal pleasures are intrinsically sinful. Romantic longing emerges, reflecting the attempt to find release in nature from the uncertainties of existence. The vision of the Golden Age, reminiscent of Rousseau's State of Nature, stresses the fleetingness of life. Homer envisioned life as the inevitable unfolding of a preordained Fata. The threads of Tyche move all creation, encompassing both men and gods. Zeus in the Iliad holds up the scales of fate.</p>
<h1 id="to-learn-not-to-determine">To Learn, Not to Determine</h1>
<p>Hector's fate illustrates man's rebellion against the inevitability of existence. His attempts to save Sarpedon and Hector--much like Achilles--represent this struggle, with the important difference that Zeus has achieved his inward peace. He understands that there is no escaping fate and abides by its decisions. Achilles, conversely, embodies man's lament over the brevity of his existence, representing an assertion of mastery over Fate and an attempt to wrest consolation from mortality. Seeking to escape objective necessity invites tragedy; attempting to set limits on one's actions characterizes the madness that equates man with God. Man's triumphs do not lie in a physical conquest of objective necessity. Achilles transcends necessity only through an inward acceptance that rises above the now unimportant alternative of a short and heroic life versus a long and commonplace one.</p>
<p>Achilles had been a prisoner of prophecy, but with his recognition of limits, he achieves freedom and meaning in his existence. This explains the structure of the Homeric poems, which emphasize the general over the unique and blend character and fate into representative types. Stressing the specific would be meaningless in a world where only the general matters.</p>
<h2 id="we-have-the-habit-of-the-acceptance-of-a-pervasive-fate">We Have the Habit of the Acceptance of a Pervasive Fate</h2>
<p>This acceptance is revealed through the hero's character. Freedom represents the undefinable essence that man imparts to Tyche's inexorability, expressed by Achilles' recognition that peace is not an external state: *"Such is the lot that Gods have spun for miserable men that they should live in pain; yet themselves are sorrowless. "</p>
<p>Only through this resignation to an inexorable Fate can Homer's heroes achieve freedom. This assertion is harsh, however. As wonder faded from the Hellenic world and the exultation of war (still noticeable in the Iliad) left only its horrors, when man began to feel apart from society--unthinkable in Homer--the question of the sanction of Fate emerged as the central problem in understanding freedom. Virgil's Aeneid testifies to this endeavor. Aeneas represents the moral man; his profound sadness reflects the essential incomprehensibility of a blindly operating necessity. He symbolizes the quest to transcend mere postulation of Fate and seek a moral ideal to validate all striving.</p>
<p>In this process, the objectivity of Homer is diminished. Virgil's history reveals the inevitable triumph of good over evil, depicted in the crassest possible terms. His hero must determine his actions out of a sense of duty rather than the absolute inner spontaneity of Homeric characters. A moral code now serves as the standard, not objective necessity, and deviations must be justified either by divine intervention (as in Dido's suicide) or tragic events (as in Pallas' death). Virgil finds freedom in the determination of will by duty, the necessity of which expresses a moral sanction. But whose sanction, within what scheme of necessity? The Augustan Empire provided no answers. The pervasive sadness of Virgil illustrates a valueless reality that lacks salvation by faith. In this inner uncertainty, Virgil's gods become undignified, and his longing pervasive and hopeless. The medieval period found an answer to Virgil's dilemma.</p>
<p>Dante, on the other hand, ascribes meaning to freedom as a recognition of necessity by imbuing it with divine sanction. There are hints of this in Homer as well. Zeus in the Iliad seems to represent the conscience of mankind, yet he is ultimately unable to save either Hector or Sarpedon. In the Odyssey, Athena tells Penelope that Telemachus will escape the wooers since he has not sinned against God; this offers fleeting hope rather than an explicit affirmation of a meaningful divine sanction.</p>
<p>To Dante, life reveals a divine plan. There is no need for the creation of representative types; the generality of Adam is symbolized by God as the creator of a meaningful universe, manifesting in all specificity. Freedom is the recognition of divine immanence achieved under the guidance of reason until the pilgrim's arrival in Paradise, where a complete fusion of will, desire, and reason occurs, leading to a blend of transcendental bliss.</p>
<p>This bliss, this wonder at the miracle of creation and the meaningfulness of fate, makes Dante more comparable to Homer than to Virgil, highlighting a youthful culture that can still perceive the mysteries of life. The divine sanction ascribed to necessity renders its recognition the true liberation, lifting man above the sensuous world.</p>
<p>"This man has come in search of liberty," Virgil tells Cato. When the will has achieved its inward realization of limits, expressed by the Confession at the river Lethe, true freedom is attained, and terrestrial bonds fall away. Dante rises above the determined necessity of the physical world and ascends through the heavens. He encounters the Saints who have achieved the inward reconciliation expressed by Picardo Donati, whose symbolic appearance in the moon is both necessary and willed: "In His Will is our Peace."</p>
<p>Life for Dante presents a process of achieving freedom in a world of transcendental bliss and purposiveness, pervaded by the love of and for God. Virgil's sadness is overcome by ascribing divine sanction to necessity. Grace, the force that unbinds the will, represents God's gift to mankind, with its possibilities symbolized by Beatrice, who guides the pilgrim's journey in the most desperate moments.</p>
<p>To will freely, yet in accordance with God's immanence, constitutes Dante's solution to the problem of freedom and necessity. This leads to an inward reconciliation that dismisses all materiality as unimportant, to a faith that transcends phenomenal necessity by infusing it with its own spirituality.</p>
<p>Milton, too, gives necessity a divine sanction but represents# Situation</p>
<p>Virtue is power, but beyond this conception of ethics as technical mastery, Spinoza had a profounder vision. His intellectual love, when conditioned by the categorical imperative, provides the only truly meaningful ethic. Naturalism is seen not to be enough. As man grows in wisdom, a vision of a higher world order opens before him. Intuition based on reason views reality under the aspect of eternity and becomes at one with the Infinite mind of God. The more man knows by this kind of knowledge, the more truly he can be said to act, and the more he participates in the divine. This is the intellectual love of God, by which humanity approaches immortality and which contains the hope of blessedness--mankind's real liberty. Knowledge of an objective necessity has developed into the intuition of an inward acceptance. Freedom for Spinoza ultimately resides in a mystic relationship to the Infinite, which would have been impossible without the guidance of reason, in a resignation that gives peace, in the tranquility of perfect knowledge.</p>
<p>Though it would be unfair to say that Spinoza's goal was a willless resignation, he offered no obvious content to ethical conduct. Kant's categorical imperative has given us a rule of universal applicability based on a rational conception of a priori principles. The nature of the transcendental experience of the moral law in Kant reveals a personality that has understood objective necessity through the categories but, beyond mere phenomena, feels an ultimate reality that makes possible an intuition of the unity of all existence and a sense of responsibility towards others--expressed as tolerance in the concept of the dignity of the individual. Knowledge of objective necessity gives power, but recognition of inward necessity gives peace.</p>
<p>"Life is painting a picture, not doing a sum," Oliver Wendell Holmes said. "As twenty men of genius looking out of the same window will paint twenty canvasses, each unlike all the others and every one great, so one comes to think men may be pardoned for the defect of their qualities if they have the qualities of their defects.... I learned in the regiment and in the class the conclusion at least of what I think the best service we can do for our country and for ourselves: to see as far as one may and to feel the great forces behind every detail--for what makes all the difference between philosophy and gossip, between great action and small; the least wavelet of the Atlantic Ocean is mightier than one of Buzzard's Bay--to hammer out as compact and solid a piece of work as one can, to try to make it first-rate and to leave it unadvertised."</p>
<p>Does this mean that all attitudes are equivalent and no absolute standard of morality exists? Is man doomed to struggle without certainty and live without assurance? In a sense, that is so; man cannot achieve a guarantee for his conduct. No technical solutions to the dilemmas of life are at hand. That is the fatedness of existence. But it also poses a challenge, providing meaning to one's life. Ethics must always reside in an inward state, in a personal recognition of limits. Reason can guide the soul to a knowledge of objective necessity, as Spinoza did.</p>
<h1 id="monstrated">Monstrated</h1>
<p>Rational principles, such as Kant's categorical imperative, may give effect to a transcendental experience. But ultimate liberation derives from within us, from an experience both personal and essentially incommunicable. Philosophy may describe the nature of ethical conduct, but it cannot enforce its acceptance. The sanction for our actions must constitute a necessity of our souls, not merely of our thought, as Schweitzer implies.</p>
<p>If morality issues from a mystic relationship, how can one reconcile this with a concept of tolerance? If our transcendental experience is, in a sense, absolute, must we not assert it against all who disagree to the limits of our strength? To be sure, the reconciliation of an ultimate but personal vision with universal applicability constitutes the problem of ethics. But moral conduct reveals not merely the will to live but a will conditioned by a reality transcending man. Freedom derives not merely from an inward state but from an experience that recognizes limits. This acceptance of tolerance, the knowledge that one must set boundaries to one's striving, will lead to the positive intuition in the concept of the dignity of the individual.</p>
<h2 id="tolerance">Tolerance</h2>
<p>Tolerance is achieved in two stages:</p>
<ol>
<li>Objective necessity teaches man his fallibility and physical weakness in the face of the unpredictability of events, as well as his material dependence on the respect and aid of his neighbors. This leads to ethical systems such as Hobbes', whose Laws of Nature represent technical rules of prudence and whose command for peace reveals the impotence of self-assertiveness.</li>
</ol>
<p>Harmony becomes a limiting condition, and tolerance a maxim of self-preservation. Inward necessity transcends this mere evaluation of empirical relations. Its experience leads to the bliss of Spinoza or Dante. It goes beyond mere resignation and becomes active in the categorical imperative of Kant.</p>
<p>Now tolerance depends not merely on an understanding of fallibility or the physical necessity of mutual support but on a vision of man as an end, the ultimate (which a religious soul may call divine), which appears as the condition of all phenomena. This leads to the experience of the dignity of man and the feeling of reverence, which overcomes the struggle for survival by an inward apprehension and transcends the necessity of its environment by viewing the world as a possibility and existence as an inward reconciliation.</p>
<h2 id="philosophy-of-inexorable-necessity">Philosophy of Inexorable Necessity</h2>
<p>What is the relation of this to the philosophy of inexorable necessity with which we live? We know the past only as a phenomenon. Even our own actions in retrospect lose the inner experience that accompanied them. The past sets the framework which our spirituality must transcend. For this reason, our two stages of recognition also appear in the philosophy of history.</p>
<p>Spengler had powerfully described history's objective necessity. But existence is also an experience, and we live the future. The past is dead and ruled by necessity, but freedom exists.</p>
<p>This concept also implies something else: It means that differences between ideologies and political systems or individuals may be so fundamental as to be unbridgeable. One can quarrel with a system such as Hobbes', which derives from an evaluation of the requisites of survival; one cannot really bridge the gulf between attitudes. The implementation of an experience is a technical problem and therefore arguable, but the experience itself is personal and incommunicable. If a man has no transcendental experience of freedom, an argument about democratic principles becomes futile.past only as a phenomenon.</p>
<p>If a person has no transcendental experience of freedom, an argument about democracy becomes a discussion of the efficiency of economic systems, which exists on the plane of objective necessity and is therefore debatable. The inward intuition of freedom, on the other hand, would reject totalitarianism even if it were economically more efficient. For this reason, arguments suggesting that international conferences with Russia can magically resolve all differences seem fallacious. If conditions are ripe, they may achieve an understanding based on objective necessity, which, like any evaluation, may be overthrown by subsequent analysis. Permanent understanding based on inward reconciliation seems to require more than conferences since the differences are more than just misunderstandings.</p>
<h2 id="premise-348">PREMISE -348&lt;</h2>
<p>Governs the future. Toynbee tried to go beyond the mere postulation of inexorability, but if objective necessity cannot serve as a guide to action, it cannot guarantee purposiveness either. Kant has opened the vistas for a resolution of this dilemma by finding a goal in life--a hope beyond the uncertainties of success. Peace and freedom in Kant reveal the state of a soul: a duty that may be difficult but also carries great responsibility. What about the disenchantment that our brief examination of literature indicated? Life involves suffering and transitoriness. No person can choose his stage or the condition of his time. The vastness of existence may rob the present of much joy and most mystery. The generation of Buchenwald and the Siberian labor camps cannot talk with the same optimism as its predecessors. The bliss of Dante has been lost in our civilization. But this describes merely a fact of decline and not its necessity. Man's existence is as transcendental a fact as the violence of history. Man's actions testify to his aspirations, which stem from an attitude of the soul, not an evaluation of conditions. To be sure, these may be tired times. But we cannot require immortality as the price for giving meaning to life. The experience of freedom enables us to rise beyond the suffering of the past and the frustrations of history. In this spirituality resides humanity's essence, the unique contribution each individual imparts to the necessity of this life: the self-transcendence that gives peace.</p>
<p>"In the last analysis, one can conclude nothing from history, as from tragedy, save that man's efforts after personal self-realization or social responsibility have been defeated at the hands of relentless fact."</p>
<p>As soon as this consciousness is reached, the enjoyment of existence is entwined with pain, frustration, loss, and tragedy.</p>
<h1 id="appendix">APPENDIX</h1>
<h2 id="the-concepts-of-meaning">The Concepts of Meaning</h2>
<h3 id="introduction_1">Introduction</h3>
<p>The problem of the meaning of history contains the dilemma inherent in all epistemology: Is truth or meaning a property of reality or the consequence of conceptual appearance? Kant opted for the latter alternative and attempted to analyze the categories that structured knowledge. Yet the scientific criticism of the 19th and 20th centuries opened seemingly limitless vistas for the manipulation of nature, leading to the assertion that reality constitutes a property of appearances and meaning connotes that quality which harmonizes subjective cognition with objective phenomena.</p>
<p>This will be considered under two aspects. The development of the logical primitive from the assertive school, through the logical positivists (sententialists), to the pre-assertional concept demonstrates the pervasiveness of the metaphysical widening of the range of meaning, finally resulting in the postulate of the pure hypothesis--the answer to which depends on metaphysical and epistemological criteria entirely.</p>
<p>The modern theory of systems rejects both the self-evidence of technical axioms and the necessary truth of reality, reducing them to real postulates that aid in the apprehension of the totality of knowledge. Meaning, in these terms, becomes the metaphysical context that ascribes significance, not an absolute relation that depends on the empirical verifiability of assertions.</p>
<h3 id="the-logical-primitive">The Logical Primitive</h3>
<p>Part of the study of logic consists of the search for a 'logical primitive,' a concept that will best express the foundation of our thought and the object of our inquiry. Yet the choice of this 'logical primitive' depends on factors outside of logic itself, on a philosophical basis.</p>
<p>Our Thinking</p>
<p>The possibility of making an assertion that is true and the feasibility of correlating logic with the physical world is foundational to propositional logic. The existential import of judgments, derived from a relation between two sets of physical objects--symbols and facts--makes sententialism (logical positivism) possible. Both propositional and sentential logic contain as a primitive an assertion, which necessitates a philosophical justification apart from the internal structure of the argument regarding the possibility and validity of such judgments.</p>
<p>The difficulties raised by these concepts, along with the encumbrance of metaphysical and epistemological considerations, gave rise to a new school of thought: pre-assertional bases. This school attempts to free itself from the pretensions of a theory of knowledge while simultaneously widening the scope of ascribing meaning.</p>
<p>Developed largely by Prof. Scheffer, this approach aims to formulate an analysis of the internal structure of statements, examining all implications prior to committing to an evaluation. However, it implies the metaphysical flexibility of meaning and judgments.</p>
<h2 id="assertional-schools-of-logic">Assertional Schools of Logic</h2>
<p>The basis of propositional logic is expressed in a judgment as a logical primitive. A judgment consists of the act of distinguishing a particular element, the predicate, in the being of a subject, which could not be thought of unless it contained some other than the predicated character. The judgment contains two elements called terms: the subject-term and the predicate-term, joined by a copula always expressed by the word 'is.' For example, 'Dogs bark!' becomes 'Dogs are things that bark!' This results from defining judgment as a condition in the being of a subject postulated by the theory of existence.</p>
<p>The distinguishing characteristic of a judgment is its truth or falsity. Only true judgments matter, for unless a person says what he does not really think, he declares the truth of his assertion. All judgments, therefore, besides affirming or denying a predicate of a subject, imply existence. This does not mean the implication of the reality of the grammatical subject but is primarily based on the existence of the whole matter of fact asserted. The statement 'Griffins are fabulous monsters!' does not affirm the existence of griffins; it implies the existence of a mass of fables in which griffins play a considerable role. If these fables did not exist, a judgment about griffins would pertain to some portion of total reality. This explains the use of the existential verb 'to be' as the copula.</p>
<p>Bradley carries this view to its ultimate conclusion: reality is not only implied by every judgment but represents the ultimate subject of every proposition.</p>
<p>The logical and ultimate subject can be illustrated by the proposition, "Morphine stimulates the heart." The grammatical subject is "morphine." The logical subject can be obtained only through a series of interrogatories, such as "What dilates the heart?" "What dilates the heart?" is the logical subject. "What do you know about morphine?" results in "morphine" as the logical subject. However, neither "Morphine" nor "dilates the heart" represents the ultimate subject. Things cannot be understood by themselves or even as a portion of reality.</p>
<p>There can exist only one real system to which all judgments refer; a particular object must have a place in this system as a requisite for its existence. This Spinozistic view leads Bradley to deny the possibility of predicating a particular element in a subject and thus implying its existence or the existence of the system to which this subject refers. The division of a judgment into subject and predicate becomes meaningless, and instead, the judgment as a whole predicates ultimate reality. Thus, reality is implied by, not requisite for, meaningful statements. A statement implies existence; what about predicates--terms implying a quality such as "the house is black"? If blackness represents an empirical entity, each judgment would have to be restated according to the speaker's vision. Traditional logicians (Bradley, Joseph, and Stebbing) find refuge in the Platonic concept of universals, which makes the concept the only true reality.</p>
<p>Propositional logic is thus founded on concepts entirely metaphysical. From there, it proceeds to classify judgments according to certainty into:</p>
<table>

<tr>
<th>Judgment Type</th>

<tr>
<td>categorical</td>

<tr>

<p>And according to quality (or modality) into:</p>
<p>| assertive          |<br />
| negative           |<br />
| problematic        |</p>
<p>It becomes apparent, however, that many of these subdivisions are in turn metaphysical. Whether a judgment is universal or enumerative depends less on the inherent structure of the proposition than on the individual's theory of knowledge. Empiricists would deny any universal judgment; Platonists would adhere to the possibility of universality even in such statements as "French ministries are short-lived."</p>
<p>The same applies to apodictic judgments. The necessity or self-evidence of a proposition constitutes a problem for epistemology, to which logic can supply no better clue than internal consistency. Judgments about griffins can be defended as implying existence; such statements as "Griffins exist!" can be satisfied only with considerable difficulty. Even Joseph is finally forced to the conclusion that statements about griffins imply their existence or being (in a system of reality), while the statement "Griffins exist" would imply not only their being but their being griffins. Thus, to ask whether griffins exist is to ask whether anything existing has the nature intended by the concept of "griffin."</p>
<p>Without existence, a griffin can be conceived.</p>
<p>This doctrine presents certain difficulties. It leaves the question of what constitutes a property. Moreover, by treating two entities, existence and...</p>
<p>Supposing a proposition is made about a subject not obviously non-existent, such as griffins, and a relation is predicated that could constitute a property, does the proposition then imply existence? According to Stebbing, this would have to be answered affirmatively. The best conclusion to be drawn from Stebbing is that propositions do not necessarily imply existence, which suffices to negate Joseph's and Bradley's theory. Thus, Stebbing discards the philosophical assumptions of propositional logic but only at the cost of making meaning a psychological attribute of the speaker. If a statement merely expresses a subjective attitude, then the metaphysical aspect of the judgment is simply shifted from the analysis to its formulation.</p>
<p>The more important aspect of Stebbing's work is the concept of descriptions derived from Russell, which constitutes a further step in the direction of making meaning the consequence of a metaphysical.</p>
<p>This shows that phrases such as 'square circle' can be used significantly even if they apply to nothing. This becomes apparent in pre-assertional logic.</p>
<p>The analysis of propositions to which such phrases apply is identical whether they describe something or nothing.</p>
<p>Two examples will illustrate. The proposition 'Scott is the author of Waverly' can be analyzed into three assertions:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td>1</td>
<td>At least one man wrote Waverly</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2</td>
<td>Only one man wrote Waverly</td>

<tr>
<td>3</td>
<td>That man is Scott.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>The proposition will be false if (1) no one had written Waverly, (2) if more than one had written Waverly, (3) if one man had written Waverly but Scott was not the man.</p>
<p>The second statement concerns what in Russell's original view would be called a logical construction: "The man in the moon is yellow."</p>

<p>This statementive is the sentence, which merely constitutes a grouping together of symbols or words. These symbols, strung together in a linear arrangement, have a property that transforms them into propositions. By being brought into relations with other physical objects--facts--they acquire meanings.</p>
<p>Meaning derives reality only from the truth-value of the proposition. Since most propositions at the time of their utterance do not have a determined truth-value, another predicate of the proposition must be invoked. All unverified sentences have a certain opinion regarding their truth attached to them, defined as the weight of the proposition. While a truth-value is a property capable of only two values, positive and negative, the weight represents a quality on a continuous scale ranging from utmost uncertainty through intermediary degrees to the reliability of the highest degree. Words such as <em>probably</em> and <em>likely</em> correspond to the weight of the proposition in ordinary language.</p>
<p>Reichenbach formulates two postulates of the truth-theory of meaning:</p>
<table>
<thead>

<th>Postulate Number</th>
<th>Postulate Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>1</td>
<td>A proposition has meaning if, and only if, it is verified as true or false.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Based entirely on Reichenbach's experience and prediction, these symbols differ in their general characteristics from other physical objects.</p>
<p>Aho</p>

<h1 id="jere">Jere</h1>
<p>True sentences have the same meaning if they obtain the same determination as true and false by every possible observation. Reichenbach's restriction of meaning to verifiable truth seems, in the first instance, a negation of the Kantian position and an assertion of reality as a predicate of objects. Yet what does Reichenbach mean by verifiability? What meaning can be attached to descriptions of physical qualities? What is the relation of truth-value to meaning and to truth-value? This finally resolves itself into a consideration of criteria of knowledge, of which three progressively wider standards are recognized: the technical, the physical, and the logical. The last, in the tradition of Hume, admits as true anything that can be conceived without contradiction.</p>
<p>This analysis implies that a statement can be both meaningful or not, depending on the criterion. A 300-year-old man, in a logical sense, represents no inner contradiction but would have to be denied by physical criteria. Moreover, just as in Russell's theory of descriptions, the assertion can only occur subsequent to a query, and the question will limit a range of possible answers. Thus, logical positivism, from an attempt to confine meaning by a test of verifiability, is forced by its inner contradictions into the admission of criteria that extend the range of meaningful statements and, by implication, becomes the precursor of pre-assertional logic, which faces the metaphysical problem only after its range has been determined by the hypotheses.</p>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>The assertional schools of logic agree in basing their logical primitive on a statement. This leads to an inquiry into the very possibility of knowledge and an ever sharper definition of epistemological concepts. A gap arises between one side and the extensive classification of types of judgments, propositions, and sentences on the other, with the middle ground of the inherent meanings of assertions inadequately analyzed.</p>
<p>The difficulty of this position results in an attempt to burst the metaphysical bounds, achieved only by an implicit affirmation of wider criteria of meaning, which are moreover made a psychological function of the speaker. Russell contains hints of such an analysis, and Reichenbach admits various levels of criteria. It remained for pre-assertional logic to develop these implications to their ultimate conclusion and thus allow for the variability of metaphysical assumptions as the condition of meaning.</p>
<h2 id="pre-assertional-logic">Pre-Assertional Logic</h2>
<p>The school of pre-assertional logic develops a different approach to the problem of meaning. Where propositional logic passes judgments about aspects of reality or establishes the relation between sentences and facts through an elaborate system of metaphysical and verifiability theory, pre-assertional logic...</p>
<h1 id="sdmita">sdmita</h1>
<p>The flexibility of the philosophical assumptions determining meaning refuses to consider questions such as the existential import of propositions as falling outside the realm of pure context. It maintains that before one can assert something, one has to know what it is that one wishes to assert. This distinguishes the eventual validity of the assertion from the inherent linguistic and logical structure of the statement. The quest for the logical primitive in pre-assertional logic resolves itself into the search for a form of expression that best exhibits the internal structure of the statement and its logical possibilities. Only after having examined the statement in such a form does pre-assertional logic attempt to pass judgment, assert, or, using the language of Prof. Scheffer, declare truth and falsity, with the express proviso that the declaration involves both a psychological element (the speaker's) and a philosophical one, depending on the criterion used.</p>
<p>Pre-assertional logic does not have to conform to the subject term copula predicate-term from the propositionalists, nor confine itself to the only test of the internal structure. It examines the internal structure of the argument and looks for a form that best exhibits its possibilities. This then is the best form of the logical primitive for pre-assertional propositional logicians, such as Joseph or Stevving, who agree that the Judgment represents only an answer to a question, the object of which constitutes the logical subject of the proposition. The assertion expresses the affirmation or denial of a hypothesis and exhibits more clearly the object of our query than the Judgment, as it is devoid of the psychological aspect of the act of judging, in which always inheres the possibility of error. The interrogative is the logical primitive of pre-assertional logic.</p>
<p>Yet, which form should this interrogative take? Three possibilities exist. Taking the statement "Chicago is large?" as an example:</p>

</tbody>
</table>
<p>The basic primitive then constitutes a question framed as a pure hypothesis that allows examination of the argument.</p>
<h1 id="before-getting-off-the-fence-and-deciding-truth">Before Getting Off the Fence and Deciding Truth</h1>
<p>Chicago being large becomes the ascriptive, the pure hypothesis offered for examination and affirmation or denial. The act of assertion occurs when the ascriptive has been examined. This, however, recognizes that judgments of truth and falsehood are subjective and dependent on a metaphysical context. Moreover, simple assertions of truth and falsity are ambiguous since they say nothing about the standard used. Pre-assertional logic attempts to overcome these difficulties by stating its criterion of judgment as well as its most applicable subdivision. Having offered Chicago being large for examination, it can reply affirmatively by an empirical criterion within which subgroup geography, perhaps denoted numerically, would be most applicable. Thus: Chicago being large.</p>
<p>Thus, logic has come full cycle. The metaphysical assumptions which structured the analysis, as well as the formulation of statements in traditional logic, proved too cumbersome. By a# Setting Off the Fence and Deciding Truth</p>
<p>Through a gradual process of widening the range of meaningful judgments, logic finds itself.</p>
<p>Anelly developed the declarative, which constitutes a frank recognition that objective criteria for meaning do not exist and that the consensus an endorsement enjoys represents its only approximation to universality. Analysis reveals that the declarative is composed of an al portion, the role of analysis in its internal structure. The act of judgment (represented by the acts in the declarative) exhibits the psychological element. The philosophical aspect is revealed in the endorsement, of which the criterion represents the metaphysical and the assertion of truth or falsity represents the epistemological viewpoint. If the statement (or declarative) derives meaning from these three components, do any criteria for its evaluation exist? No absolute standards of validity are at hand. The declarative can, in turn, be transformed into an ascriptive, and its endorsement subjected to epistemological criticism. (Thus: Chicago being large)</p>
<p>But ultimate criteria of meaning or the realm of the empirically positive can never be faced by pre-assertional logic, for total meaning is not exhausted by empirical verifiability, and proper standards can be obtained for aesthetic or value judgments.</p>
<p>If logic can be defined as the critical analysis of inherent structure apart from the relation to other fields, then the pre-assertional school has offered the best solution, as it does not rely on epistemological presuppositions but attempts to analyze the implications of the hypothesis before its final judgment of validity.</p>
<h2 id="relchenbach-experience-and-prediction">Relchenbach Experience and Prediction</h2>
<p>With this, it merely amounts to a recognition of the variability of possibilities of meaning.

<p>If the hypothesis limits the range of answers, what is the...</p>
<h1 id="effect-on-systematic-knowledge">Effect on Systematic Knowledge</h1>
<p>Are all hypotheses equivalent, their choices accidental, their pertinence purely psychological? The theory of systems addresses itself to these problems. A system has been defined as any body of propositions.</p>
<p>The Theory of Systems</p>
<p>A logical consequence of every proposition is that after a certain one, it contains some or all of the preceding propositions. This body of propositions that implies the rest has been defined by Professor Scheffer. The necessity of the code results from the limitations of the human mind. A being, such as God, whose knowledge is instantaneous, would have no recourse to a code. Yet the average person, who cannot grasp the totality of the propositions contained in the system without deduction, requires a body of propositions from which such a deduction can be effected. Few classical sciences and no empirical sciences have, in fact, been completely systematized, though all systematic knowledge presupposes a system, its extent usually indicated by the necessity which attends conclusions.</p>
<p>Historically, it had been assumed that all systems, such as Euclidean geometry, were based on a set of propositions self-evidently true, the axioms, from which all other propositions, theorems, followed deductively. Mathematicians have proved that the Euclidean axioms cannot be considered universally self-evident. For example, it is possible to conceive a world entirely enclosed within a large sphere, with the temperature decreasing point by point, reaching zero at the boundary. In such a world, every inhabitant would conceive himself in a universe of infinite extent, for as he approached the boundary, the falling temperature would decrease his size, causing his steps to be smaller and smaller. The geometry of such a "world" would contain many axioms, the self-evidence of which would vary considerably from Euclid's. It can be proved that the shortest distance between two points in that case would be the arc of a circle, which cuts the bounding sphere orthogonally. This is the basis of non-Euclidean mathematics.</p>
<p>Moreover, from the point of view of modern logic, "self-evidence" cannot be conceived as a predicate of a proposition but as a diadic relation between the person making the statement and the proposition. The reality of the system does not result from its foundation in empirically verifiable fact but from the philosophical assumptions of its postulates.</p>
<p>Professor Royce has classified the various assumptions underlying the use of the term axiom. It can be applied either in the sense of inner necessity or self-evidence, subjective necessity.</p>
<p>The MRS A Tests in Eye, Trp Rey the RTI NT the OY Ta Pare at MOY Tae 2</p>
<p>An axiom is an unproved hypothesis from which, however, other propositions can be deduced, as a proposition universally assented to, and lastly as a proposition resulting from an individual's psycho-genetic constitution. The <em>inner necessity theory</em> is discarded because of the impossibility of defining a criterion for certainty. "True apes and Spinoza," for example, despite the whole philosophy being based on innate ideas, could offer no better criterion than inner conviction. According to Professor Royce, this criterion can only qualify in the sense of "subjective certainty," not self-evidence, and there is no necessary connection between the statement "This is true" and the objective reality of the subject.</p>
<p>The second context in which the term "axiom" has been used, as an unproved hypothesis, will be discussed fully below. In the Aristotelean senses, by which a first principle must inhere in all scientific deductions as a part of a universal first principle, the discovery of a valid system, though its axioms might have been assumed as hypotheses to start with, imparts to those axioms a certain, highly mediated *self-evidence. For practical purposes, however, this self-evidence is equivalent to the assumption of an unproved hypothesis as a starting point.</p>
<p>The third conception of universal assent defining an axiom implies its own contradiction, according to Professor Royce. For one would not invoke universal assent as an argument, except against a person not assenting. One dissent will therefore shake the validity of the axiom, forcing recourse to such limitations on universality# Generalization of the Notion of a Code</p>

<h1 id="ani-existence">Ani Existence</h1>
<p>An assertion about the existence of a 60-year-old man would be consistent, but it could also be inconsistent. Although this limits the analysis to internal consistency, it tells us nothing about a criterion. Yet, an absolute standard for consistency does not exist. To prove consistency, concepts are utilized that are, in turn, assumed to be consistent. A test for consistency, with these reservations, would be the deduction of the pre-code as a theorem from a code of logic that is assumed to be consistent.</p>
<p>A more general test for consistency is the instantiation of the pre-code. There are possibilities of instantiation--logical, mathematical, or empirical. Thus, if the pre-code is instantiated by a code in Euclidean geometry, and we grant that Euclidean geometry is consistent, we have a proof for the consistency of the pre-code. An example of this is found in Whitehead's <em>Principia Mathematica</em>, which attempts to demonstrate the foundation of mathematics through instantiation in an empirical system. The element of simply passing the burden of proof to a higher order of logic or another set of assumptions is compounded by the following epistemological assumptions:</p>
<p>The empirical world is consistent. Therefore, this part of the physical world is consistent. And our propositions about this part are true. Therefore, the code regarding this part is true. 5. Therefore, the logical portion of the pre-code is consistent.</p>
<p>Thus, the test of the system is internal consistency, which leaves the scope of the metaphysical assumptions unsanalyzed. This raises the question of the use of a pre-code. For generalizing the notion of a code, the possibility of instantiation across different sciences is given. The realization that two different sciences have the same logical structure (that is, utilizing the same pre-code) is preliminary to translating one science into another. This is essentially the procedure followed by Descartes in transforming algebra into geometry.</p>
<p>The theory of systems then contains an examination of a certain unity in nature. This unity is no longer provided by self-evident propositions but is instead derived from studying all the implications and code-descriptives which obtain their validity from the appropriate criterion. Yet, this unity allows for a variability of metaphysical assumptions and a multiplicity of valid criteria.</p>
<p>The only necessary postulate is internal consistency, which in turn recognizes epistemological limitations. Meaning is recognized as an emanation of a philosophical point of view. This also applies to a philosophy of history. Historical data by itself is neutral; its significance constitutes a function of the resolve of a soul. This does not imply that all metaphysical constructions are equivalent, that an unlimited choice exists in the selection of hypotheses, or that historical data may be ignored. A hypothesis and its relevance to this framework constitute a test for its efficacy. The wider the history seeks to explain, the more robust the framework must be.</p>
<p>The more profound its approach, the more tyrants by themselves testify only to a fact of occurrence. Phenomenal appearances contain no moral sanction and can be apprehended only as a category of necessity. Their inner meaning must always remain a metaphysical creation.</p>

<h2 id="ch-1-introduction">Ch. 1. Introduction</h2>
<p>Progress and freedom, purpose and meaning, are not attributes of reality, but the revelation of an inward experience.</p>
<p>Gibbon thought that he saw in Rome's collapse the triumph of barbarism and religion. Yet, an excellent case has been made from Alexander's conquests. He considers the Peloponnesian War the beginning of Hellenistic disintegration.</p>
<p>Similarly, what caused Hitler's downfall? Was it the invasion of Russia, the declaration of war in 1939, the seizure of Czechoslovakia, or the Anschluss? Or perhaps was the fact of collapse permanent in a personality to whom the recognition of limits constituted an admission of defeat? An answer to these questions is not contained merely in empirical data but in its interpretation, which depends on the predispositions of its author. Hume's constant conjunction must ever represent a philosophical resolution. Consequently, there cannot exist one universally valid philosophy of history. It portrays the metaphysical resolution of the dilemma of the experiences of freedom and the knowledge of necessity and represents as much a testimony to the philosophical assumptions of its creators as an absolute standard for the evaluation of nominal history. Since the content ascribed to life, moreover, constitutes the emanation of an inner state, the possibility arises for the attainment of a level of meaning transcending the mere phenomenal appearance of power phenomena.</p>
<p>Kant's ethical philosophy testifies to this solution, the ultimate reality of which is only accessible by way of an inner experience.</p>
